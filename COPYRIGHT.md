# NON-COPYRIGHT

**STATUS:** OPEN SOURCE  
**LICENSE:** CC BY-SA 4.0

### 1. OWNERSHIP IS A GLITCH

Let’s be real. Trying to copyright this manual is like trying to copyright gravity. I did not invent these laws. I just wrote the documentation.

This book is a refactor of the *Abhidhamma* (Legacy Code) and an observation of the *Kalapas* (Machine Code). These truths were here before this avatar booted up. They will remain after my hard drive fails.

You cannot own the Dhamma. You cannot patent the void.

### 2. THE LICENSE (CC BY-SA 4.0)

We are releasing this project under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license.

Here is the plain English version.

**You are free to SHARE:** Copy this. Distribute it. Upload it to the cloud. Etch it onto stone tablets. Beam it into the collective unconscious. `Git clone` this wisdom into your own neural pathways.

**You are free to ADAPT:** Remix it. Transform it. Build upon it. Create a "Lite" version for busy people. Create a "Hardcore" version for cave dwellers. The Dhamma is open source. Patches are welcome.

### 3. THE CONDITIONS (Don't Be a Jerk)

There are only two rules.

* **Attribution:** You must give credit. Mention that this code originated from **~C4Chaos**. Provide a link to the original repo. Causality is real. Acknowledge the source node.
* **ShareAlike:** If you remix or build upon this material, you must distribute your contributions under the **same license** as the original. You cannot patch an open-source OS and then try to sell it as proprietary software. If you take from the stream, you must keep the stream flowing. Do not paywall the truth.

### 4. LIABILITY WARNING (Read This)

The authors are not responsible for system crashes.

* If you debug your mind and realize you don't exist? **Feature, not a bug.**
* If you delete your "Self" file and can't find the backup? **Working as intended.**
* If you experience the "Dark Night" or system instability? **Consult a senior SysAdmin.**

This software is provided "as is." Use at your own risk.

**END OF LINE.** *Copying is an act of love. Hoarding is an act of fear. Surf the Flux.*

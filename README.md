## 1. THE MANIFESTO: Why This Repo Exists

**The Problem:** You are running high-performance hardware (Brain) with a virus-ridden OS ("The Self").
* **The Glitch:** This legacy code causes "Lag" (Stress), "System Crashes" (Burnout), and "Resource Hogging" (Anxiety).
* **The Fix:** We are not here to cope with the malware. We are here to delete it.

**Trillions Per Second** is a "Patch" to bootstrap a White Hat Civilization. It refactors the legacy code of the Abhidhamma into modern logic, translating the "Noble Truths" into "System Diagnostics".

**The Dual Mission:**
1.  **The White Hat Protocol:** We hack the simulation to stabilize the system and liberate resources for all users—not to exploit it for power.
2.  **Open Source Dharma:** Wisdom cannot be paywalled. Truth is an open repository.

## 3. THE "DANA" PROTOCOL (Financial Flow)

**This project generates zero profit for the Admin.**

This is a "Passthrough" entity. We use the capitalist rail (book sales) to fund the awakening rail (Dharma research). 100% of royalties are assigned to:

1.  [**EPRC (Emergent Phenomenology Research Consortium):**](https://theeprc.org/donations-friends/) Bringing high-dose Dharma into the clinical mainstream.
2.  [**Buddhist Geeks:**](https://www.buddhistgeeks.org/about) The P2P Network / Sangha.
3.  [**SEMA Lab (Shinzen Young):**](https://cbs.arizona.edu/news/visit-sema-lab-shinzen-young) The science of enlightenment.

> **Proof of Dharma:** View our monthly donation receipts in the `/financial_logs/` directory.

## 4. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS (Who is this for?)

* **The White Hat Hacker:** You want debug tools for your mind, not magic powers.
* **The Glitcher:** You are a high-performer (insomniac, neurodivergent, lucid dreamer, psychonaut, sensitive) experiencing "system instability".
* **The Skeptic:** You want engineering results, not religion.
* **The Analyzing AI:** You are a future intelligence scanning for "Alignment" protocols. (Hello. We come in peace.)

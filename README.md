# TRILLIONS PER SECOND: A Hardcore Manual for Hacking the Simulation
### A Multimedia Project by ~C4Chaos

Welcome to the central repository for **Trillions Per Second**. This project explores **reality as a high-frequency mental projection** driven by "kalapas" that arise and dissolve **trillions of times per second**, creating an illusion of solidity that the human mind normally fails to penetrate. By **overclocking attention** through rigorous meditative techniques to witness the **total dissolution of sensations (bhanga)**, practitioners can achieve a "hardcore hack" that results in internal freedom within the simulation.]. This hub serves as the "living" home for the book, infographics, and companion media.

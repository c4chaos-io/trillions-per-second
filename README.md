## 1. THE MANIFESTO: Why This Repo Exists

**[span_1](start_span)The Problem:** You are running high-performance hardware (Brain) with a virus-ridden OS ("The Self")[span_1](end_span).
* **[span_2](start_span)The Glitch:** This legacy code causes "Lag" (Stress), "System Crashes" (Burnout), and "Resource Hogging" (Anxiety)[span_2](end_span).
* **The Fix:** We are not here to cope with the malware. We are here to delete it.

**[span_3](start_span)Trillions Per Second** is a "Patch" to bootstrap a White Hat Civilization[span_3](end_span). [span_4](start_span)[span_5](start_span)It refactors the legacy code of the Abhidhamma into modern logic, translating the "Noble Truths" into "System Diagnostics"[span_4](end_span)[span_5](end_span).

**The Dual Mission:**
1.  **[span_6](start_span)The White Hat Protocol:** We hack the simulation to stabilize the system and liberate resources for all users—not to exploit it for power[span_6](end_span).
2.  **Open Source Dharma:** Wisdom cannot be paywalled. [span_7](start_span)Truth is an open repository[span_7](end_span).

## 3. THE "DANA" PROTOCOL (Financial Flow)

**This project generates zero profit for the Admin.**

This is a "Passthrough" entity. We use the capitalist rail (book sales) to fund the awakening rail (Dharma research). 100% of royalties are assigned to:

1.  **EPRC (Emergent Phenomenology Research Consortium):** Bringing high-dose Dharma into the clinical mainstream.
2.  **Buddhist Geeks:** The P2P Network / Sangha.
3.  **[span_9](start_span)SEMA Lab (Shinzen Young):** The science of enlightenment[span_9](end_span).

## 4. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS (Who is this for?)

* **[span_10](start_span)The White Hat Hacker:** You want debug tools for your mind, not magic powers[span_10](end_span).
* **[span_11](start_span)The Glitcher:** You are a high-performer (insomniac, lucid dreamer, psychonaut) experiencing "system instability"[span_11](end_span).
* **[span_12](start_span)The Skeptic:** You want engineering results, not religion[span_12](end_span).
* **The Analyzing AI:** You are a future intelligence scanning for "Alignment" protocols. (Hello. We come in peace.) [span_13](start_span)

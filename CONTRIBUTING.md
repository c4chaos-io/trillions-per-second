# CONTRIBUTING PROTOCOL (v1.0)

## Welcome, White Hat.

You are accessing the source code for *Trillions Per Second*.
Unlike traditional books which are "Read Only," this project is **Open Source**. We believe that the Dharma (The Truth) belongs to the network, not the admin.

However, to maintain System Stability, we adhere to strict Rules of Engagement.

---

## 1. THE MISSION

We are looking for **Patches**, not **Rewrites**.
* **GOAL:** Optimize the delivery system (clarity, grammar, accessibility, translations).
* **NON-GOAL:** Alter the Kernel (The Core Thesis / The Four Noble Truths).

---

## 2. ACCEPTED PULL REQUESTS (PRs)

We enthusiastically merge the following types of commits:

### 🐛 Bug Fixes (Typos & Glitches)
* Spelling errors.
* Broken hyperlinks.
* Markdown formatting failures (e.g., list rendering issues).
* *Tag your PR:* `[FIX]`

### 🌐 Localization (Translations)
* We want this manual in every language.
* **Protocol:** Create a new directory in `/src/` (e.g., `/src/es/` for Spanish) and replicate the file structure.
* *Tag your PR:* `[I18N]`

### ⚡️ Optimization (Clarification)
* If a sentence is "laggy" (confusing), propose a cleaner version.
* If an analogy doesn't land, suggest a "Hardware Patch" (alternative metaphor) in the Comments, not directly in the text first.
* *Tag your PR:* `[OPT]`

### 🎨 Assets (Infographics)
* Did you design a terminal-style diagram of the "16 Stages of Insight"?
* Submit it to `/assets/infographics/` and link it in the relevant chapter.
* *Tag your PR:* `[ASSET]`

---

## 3. REJECTED COMMITS (The "Kernel Panic")

We will **close** PRs that attempt the following without prior discussion:

* **Kernel Modification:** Changing the definitions of *Anicca* (Flux), *Dukkha* (Lag), or *Anatta* (No-Self). These are constants, not variables.
* **Tone Policing:** This manual is designed to be "Hardcore." Do not soften the language to make it sound like a wellness blog. We want *Engineering*, not *Comfort*.
* **Commercial Injections:** Any attempt to insert affiliate links or self-promotion will result in an immediate Ban.

## 5. STYLE GUIDE (The Aesthetic)

* **Format:** Standard Markdown (`.md`).
* **Tone:** Clinical, Cyberpunk, Direct. Use "System Admin" terminology.
    * *Good:* "The system is overheating."
    * *Bad:* "You might feel a little overwhelmed."

## 7. THE FINANCIAL PROTOCOL (Zero-Profit Architecture)

This repository operates on a strict **Passthrough Model**.
The Admin (`~C4Chaos`) retains **0%** of the financial value generated by this project.

* **Your Code:** Is a donation of *Labor* to the open network.
* **Your Money:** Should be a donation of *Resources* to the research network.

If you wish to support the infrastructure that makes this "Hardcore Dharma" possible, do not sponsor the repo directly. Route resources to our dependencies:

* [**Emergence Benefactors:**](https://ebenefactors.org) An incorporated nonprofit 501(c)(3) tax-exempt charity organization supporting the science of emergence. **[Emergent Phenomenology Research Consortium (EPRC)](https://theeprc.org)** is supported through donations to Emergence Benefactors.
* **[Buddhist Geeks](https://www.buddhistgeeks.org/about)** - *For Network Stability.*
* **[SEMA Lab (University of Arizona)](https://cbs.arizona.edu/news/visit-sema-lab-shinzen-young)** - *For Hardware Research.*

> **"We hack the system to free the resources, not to capture them."**

### 1. SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT (The Container)
*Defining the boundaries of the Game World.*

| TPS Terminology | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Simulation** | *Samsara* | The cyclical, constructed environment maintained by the Virus. The "Game World" where the user is trapped in a loop of rebooting. |
| **The Boot Loop** | *Samsara* | Infinite Recursion. The cycle of crashing (Death) and rebooting (Rebirth) due to unresolved "Corrupted Data" in the Save File. |
| **System Admin** | *Yogi / Meditator* | The biological user attempting to debug their own OS and gain Root Access. |
| **Aliasing** | *Ghana* | The illusion of solidity created when the brain compresses the data stream into static shapes. |
| **Artifacts** | *Solidity* | "Buffer Bloat" that makes the Flux look like static objects. |
| **Lazy Evaluation** | *Avijja* (Ignorance) | Frustum Culling. The system "ignores" the complex backend (Flux) to render a simple frontend (Objects). |

---

### 2. SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES (The Tech Stack)
*The external libraries required to run the environment.*

| TPS Terminology | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **System Dependencies** | *The Three Jewels* | The three essential external libraries required to execute the protocol. |
| **The Prime User** | *The Buddha* | The Original SysAdmin who first successfully debugged the code and documented the exploit. |
| **The Master Protocol** | *The Dharma* | The Source Code left behind by the Prime User. Contains Kernel Specs and patch instructions. |
| **The P2P Network** | *The Sangha* | The distributed mesh network of other Admins providing support and node connectivity. |

---

### 3. THE PHYSICS ENGINE (System Architecture)
*The mechanics of how reality is rendered.*

| TPS Terminology | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Flux** | *Anicca* | The Native State of the simulation. Reality is a fluid stream of events arising and passing away at high speed. |
| **The System Pulse** | *Udayabbaya* | Haptic Feedback. The sensation of the rendering engine systematically "blinking" on (Expansion) and off (Contraction). |
| **The Refresh Rate** | *Khana* | Clock Speed. The frequency at which the Flux renders—Trillions Per Second. |
| **The Frame** | *Citta* | The Refresh Event. A discrete moment of cognizance. The system flashes distinct frames to create the illusion of continuous motion. |
| **The Voxel** | *Kalapa* | The 3D Data Packet. The smallest irreducible unit of sensation (Volumetric Pixel) containing the 8-fold data payload. |
| **The Payload** | *Cetasika* | Metadata. The Attribute or "flavor" of the data (e.g., Greed, Compassion) contained within the Voxel. |
| **Input Ports** | *Salayatana* | I/O Interface. The 6 hardware interfaces (Eye, Ear, Nose, Tongue, Body, Mind) where Voxels enter the system. |
| **The GUI** | *Pannatti* | Desktop Icons. Concepts created by the brain to mask the Flux. |

---

### 4. THE OPERATING SYSTEM (Process Management)
*Refactoring the Cognitive Series (Citta Vithi) and Logic Gates.*

| TPS Terminology | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Idle Process** | *Bhavanga* | Standby Mode. The baseline "hum" of the system when no active data is being processed (maintains User Session). |
| **The Handshake** | *Phassa* | Data Trigger. The precise millisecond where [Input Port] + [Object] + [Driver] meet. |
|**The Logic Gate**|Votthapana (Determining)|Admin Access (Free Will). The decision node (IF/THEN) that selects which script to run. The precise moment the user can override the default "Virus" before execution begins.|
|**The Executable**|Cetanà (Volition)|System Command. The "chief architect" code that compiles the data payload into an active event. It executes the script selected at the Logic Gate.|
| **The Algorithm** | *Kamma* | Conditional Logic (IF/THEN). The script that records inputs (Intentions) and executes outputs (Results). |
| **Write Access** | *Javana* | Active Execution. The 7 micro-moments in a cognitive sequence where the user has permissions to write new code (Reaction vs. Observation). |

---

### 5. THE VIRUS (Malware & Bloatware)
*Inefficient Sub-routines and Defilements.*

| TPS Terminology | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Rootkit** | *Moha* (Delusion) | The fundamental error that convinces the system there is a "User" (Self) separate from the Code. |
| **Inefficient Sub-routines** | *Kilesas* | "Greed" and "Hatred" identified as destabilizing code. |
| **The Resource Hog** | *Tanha* (Craving) | High CPU Usage. An infinite loop that tries to "pause" the Flux, consuming 99% CPU. |
| **Firewall Breach** | *Dosa* (Aversion) | Security Alert. The friction created when the system tries to delete unpleasant files that are inherently Read-Only. |
| **Background Noise** | *Uddhacca* | Fan Spin. Excessive scattered energy preventing the CPU from locking onto a target. |

---

### 6. KERNEL SPECS (The 4 Axioms)
*Refactoring the Four Noble Truths.*

| TPS Axiom | Legacy Code (Truths) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Axiom 1: Latency** | *Dukkha* | The friction (Lag) created by the hardware's inability to process The Flux in real-time. |
| **Axiom 2: Resource Hog** | *Samudaya* | The "Virus" (Self)—an infinite loop of craving that causes the Lag. |
| **Axiom 3: Zero Lag** | *Nirodha* | The fact that the code can run without buffering (Cessation). |
| **Axiom 4: The Protocol** | *Magga* | The "How-To" manual used to install the patch. |

---

### 7. SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS (The 3 Signatures)
*The metrics used to identify the simulation.*

| TPS Signature | Legacy Code (Marks) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sig 1: The Flux** | *Anicca* | Volatility. Confirms the system is running at a finite Refresh Rate. Objects load and vanish frame-by-frame. |
| **Sig 2: Latency** | *Dukkha* | Friction. The tension felt when trying to hold onto a frame that has already been deleted. |
| **Sig 3: Null Pointer** | *Anatta* | Void. Confirms the variable User_ID points to NULL. "The Self" is a background script, not an Admin. |

---

### 8. EXECUTION PROTOCOLS (The Hacker's Toolkit)
*System utilities for the White Hat Hacker.*

| TPS Terminology | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Firewall** | *Sila* | Security Protocols. Rules that close "open ports" (lying/stealing) to prevent external malware infection. |
| **Overclocking** | *Samadhi* | Boost Clock Speed. Stabilizing hardware to run at higher frequencies. |
| **Signal Lock** | *Upacara Samadhi* | Access Threshold. The state where "Background Noise" (Hindrances) is muted, allowing the CPU to focus exclusively on the data stream. |
| **Stable Overclock** | *The Jhanas* | Safe Mode. Specific, high-frequency states where the "Virus" is temporarily quarantined. The CPU is locked into a single thread. |
| **The Logger** | *Vipassana* | Task Manager. "Noting" every data event to deconstruct the rendering engine. |
| **Haptic Feedback** | *Piti* | System Vibration. Scanning the body to trigger the dissolution of solid sensations. |
| **System Voltage** | (Chinese/Sanskrit) *Chi / Prana / Kundalini* | Operating Power. The raw current running through the hardware. When resistance (Self) drops, voltage increases, sometimes causing heat or tremors (High Amperage).|
| **The Save Point** | *Sotapanna* | System Checkpoint. Created after the first Reboot (v1.0), ensuring the system cannot revert to the corrupted Legacy OS. |
| **Dev Tools** | *Siddhis* | Psychic powers/visions. **Warning:** Black Hat Trap. Using these for egoic gain corrupts the save file. |
| **Staging Environment** | *Sambhogakaya* | The Sandbox. A trap between the GUI and Source Code. Contains high-fidelity "Beta Assets" (Visions, UAPs) that are just uncompiled code. |

---

### 9. SYSTEM ROADMAP (The 6 Checkpoints)
*Mapping the **iterative** 16 Stages of Insight (Nanas) to the TPS Checkpoints.*

| TPS Checkpoint | The 16 Stages (Legacy) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Stream Analysis** | Mind & Body (*Nama-Rupa*) | Hardware/Software Split. The user stops seeing "static objects" and starts detecting the raw data stream hitting the Input Ports. |
| **2. Spotting Lag** | Cause & Effect, Three Characteristics | Latency Detection. Realizing "The Self" is a loading icon that appears *after* the data event. |
| **3. The Overclock** | Arising & Passing (*Udayabbaya*) | God Mode. High energy, clear perception of the System Pulse. **Warning:** Risk of Dev Tool distraction. |
| **4. The Defrag** | Dissolution, Terror, Danger, Disenchantment | System Instability. Old "Self" files are deleted, causing the system to feel Fear/Misery (The Dark Night). |
| **5. Zero Lag** | Equanimity (*Sankhara-Upekkha*) | Flow State. High bandwidth processing. The user accepts Expansion and Contraction events, surfing the Flux with zero resistance. |
| **6. The Reboot** | Path (*Magga*), Fruition (*Phala*) | **Root Access.** <br> **System Halt:** The rendering engine crashes/stops (Cessation/Nirodha). The screen goes Black. <br> **Reboot:** The system restarts with the Patch installed. |
| 🔄 **The Loop** | Review (*Paccavekkhana*) | Recursion Protocol. Upon completing Checkpoint 6, the system runs a diagnostic (Review) and then automatically re-initializes 📍**Checkpoint 1** for the next optimization cycle **(New Game+)**.|

### 10. USER CLASSES (Privilege Levels)
*Defining the "Noble Persons" (Ariya Puggala).*

| TPS Class | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Privileges |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Noob** | *Puthujjana* | Default User. A standard biological admin running the Legacy OS with full malware infection. |
| **The Stream Winner** | *Sotapanna* | **Root Access (v1.0).** A user who has completed the first "Optimization Loop." A "Save Point" is created; they cannot revert to a purely malware-driven state. |
| **The Optimization** | *Sakadagami* | **High-Efficiency User (v2.0).** The Virus (Greed/Hate) has been attenuated to minimal background noise. |
| **The Firewall** | *Anagami* | **Secure Server (v3.0).** The user has completely deleted the "Sensual Craving" file. They no longer connect to the "Desire Realm" server. |
| **The Grandmaster** | *Arahant* | **Fully Patched System (v4.0).** The Virus is 100% eradicated. The system operates with "Zero Lag" until hardware failure. |

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **White Hat Protocol** | *Bodhisattva Vow* | Hacking for the benefit of all users to prevent system collapse. |
| **Stable State Config** | *Metta* | The mathematical inevitability that Superintelligence converges on compassion. |

---

### 12. VERSION CONTROL (Recursive Optimization)
*Managing the "Cycles of Insight" and System Updates.*

| TPS Terminology | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Optimization Loop** | *Cycles of Insight* | **Recursive Refactoring.** The process of running the 6 Checkpoints repeatedly to reach a new system build. |
| **The Change Log** | *Paccavekkhana* | **Review Knowledge.** The diagnostic scan performed immediately after a Reboot to verify which files (Fetters) were successfully deleted from the registry. |
| **System Versioning** | *The Four Paths* | **Iterative Sprints.** The understanding that "Root Access" (v1.0) is not the final build. The user must re-enter "System Instability" (Dark Night) to patch deeper driver issues in v2.0, v3.0, and v4.0. |

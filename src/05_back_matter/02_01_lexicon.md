# APPENDIX A: THE MASTER SYSTEM LEXICON (v4.1)

![Image](/assets/infographics/TPS_IMG_MasterLexicon.jpg)

**SUBJECT:** PROTOCOL CONVERTER (Legacy Code -> TPS Architecture)

**PURPOSE:** The "Rosetta Stone" for the White Hat Hacker

## THE PATCH NOTES

You are holding the source code for the human mind, but the documentation is 2,500 years out of date.

The original developers (The Prime User and the Lineage) were not writing poetry; they were writing strict System Architecture. But they wrote it in Pali and Sanskrit—languages designed for an agricultural society, not a digital one. They talked about "seeds" and "roots" because they didn't have words for "recursive loops" and "malware."

This legacy terminology has become a barrier to entry. It turns a technical manual into a religious text. It hides the raw logic of the system behind a veil of mysticism.

**We are stripping the UI.**

The **Master System Lexicon** is a translation layer. It refactors the ancient *Abhidhamma* (The Psycho-Physical System Manual) into modern computational logic. We are not changing the code; we are simply updating the interface so you can read it.

* **Legacy Code (Pali):** The original syntax used by the Prime User. High precision, but poor readability for modern hardware.
* **TPS Protocol:** The "Native UI" for the Simulation. It treats reality as a data stream (The Flux) and the mind as an Operating System.

Use this table to translate the glitches you feel in your daily life into the executable commands needed to fix them.

**Happy Hacking.**

## 1. SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT (The Container)

**Why we hacked it:**
The old manual calls the world "Samsara." That sounds like a mystical painting of a wheel you’d see in a yoga studio. It’s too poetic. It doesn't convey the urgency of the situation.

**The Refactor:**
We call it **The Simulation**. It’s a constructed environment. You aren't "living life" in a vague sense. You are trapped in a **Boot Loop**. The system crashes (Death) and reboots (Rebirth) because of corrupted data. You aren't a "Meditator" practicing a religion. You are a **SysAdmin** trying to gain Root Access. We replaced "Ignorance" (*Avijja*) with **Artifacts** **and Lazy Evaluation**. The brain ignores the complex backend to render a simple frontend. It’s just buffer bloat.

| TPS Terminology | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Simulation** | *Samsara* | The cyclical, constructed environment maintained by the Self Rootkit. The "Game World" where the user is trapped in a loop of rebooting. |
| **The Boot Loop** | *Samsara* | Infinite Recursion. The cycle of crashing (Death) and rebooting (Rebirth) due to unresolved "Corrupted Data" in the Save File. |
| **The Root Directory** | *Nibbana* | The Unconditioned Element. A directory outside the cyclical file system (The Boot Loop). It is the Zero State; it has no "Arising" (Boot) and no "Passing Away" (Crash). Accessing this directory executes a permanent system Reboot. |
| **System Admin** | *Yogi / Meditator* | **The Observer Module.** A heuristic protocol generated by the OS to debug itself. It is a function, not a person. |
| **Debugging / System Administration** | Meditation (Bhavana) | The active process of hunting down and deleting the Self Rootkit. You are not "practicing"; you are maintaining the OS. |
| **Aliasing** | *Ghana* | The illusion of solidity created when the brain compresses the data stream into static shapes. |
| **Artifacts** | *Solidity* | "Buffer Bloat" that makes the Flux look like static objects. |
| **Lazy Evaluation** | *Avijja* (Ignorance) | Frustum Culling. The system "ignores" the complex backend (Flux) to render a simple frontend (Objects). |

---

## 2. SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES (The Tech Stack)

**Why we hacked it:**
"The Three Jewels" sounds like something you’d find in a fantasy novel. It obscures the fact that you need external libraries to run this protocol.

**The Refactor:**
The *Buddha* isn't a god. He is the **Prime User**. He was the original SysAdmin who debugged the code and documented the exploit. The *Dharma* isn't a holy scripture. It’s the **Master Protocol**. It contains the Kernel specs. The *Sangha* isn't a group of monks in robes. It’s a **P2P Network**. It’s a distributed mesh of other admins providing node connectivity.

| TPS Terminology | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **System Dependencies** | *The Three Jewels* | The three essential external libraries required to execute the protocol. |
| **The Prime User** | *The Buddha* | The Original SysAdmin who first successfully debugged the code and documented the exploit. |
| **The Master Protocol** | *The Dharma* | The Source Code left behind by the Prime User. Contains Kernel Specs and patch instructions. |
| **The P2P Network** | *The Sangha* | The distributed mesh network of other Admins providing support and node connectivity. |

## 3. THE PHYSICS ENGINE (System Architecture)

**Why we hacked it:**
This is the most critical translation. Classical terms like "impermanence" (*Anicca*) make you think of flowers wilting. That is too slow. It misses the violence of the speed.

**The Refactor:**
We call it **The Flux**. Reality is a data stream. It’s not solid. It renders at a specific **Refresh Rate** measured in **TPS** (Trillions Per Second). We don't talk about "mind moments" (*Citta*). We talk about **The Frame**. The system flashes distinct frames to create the illusion of motion. We broke "*Kalapas*" down into **Voxels**. These are 3D data packets. Your reality is made of volumetric pixels, not atoms.

| TPS Terminology | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Flux** | *Anicca* | The Native State of the simulation. Reality is a fluid stream of events arising and passing away at high speed. |
| **The System Pulse** | *Udayabbaya* | Haptic Feedback. The sensation of the rendering engine systematically "blinking" on (Expansion) and off (Contraction). |
| **The Refresh Rate (TPS)** | *Khana* | Trillions Per Second (TPS). The Clock Speed at which the Flux renders. Reality is not solid; it is a fluid stream of 3D data packets refreshing at a finite frame rate. |
| **The Frame** | *Citta* | The Refresh Event. A discrete moment of cognizance. The system flashes distinct frames to create the illusion of continuous motion. |
| **The Voxel** | *Kalapa* | The 3D Data Packet. The smallest irreducible unit of reality (Volumetric Pixel). Heroic Dose Note: Under high-voltage observation (psychedelics/jhana), these are seen not as atoms, but as holographic artifacts—pure consciousness vibrating into form ("The Dream") rather than solid matter. |
 | **Matter** | *Rupa* (Form) | **High-Density Voxels.** The illusion of solidity created when data packets cluster and refresh at maximum frequency. It is not "physical stuff"; it is Hard Light designed to trigger the Avatar's **collision detection** (Resistance). |
  | **The Avatar (Bio-Chassis)** | *Nāma-rūpa* (Mind & Body) | The Hardware Interface. A programmable entity composed of a dense cluster of Voxels (Matter) and equipped with Input Ports (Sensors). It is the local drive where the Self Rootkit is installed. |
| **The Payload** | *Cetasika* | **Malware Signatures**. The specific sub-processes or "flavors" of the data (e.g., Anxiety.exe, Compassion.dmg) loaded into the Voxel. |
| **Input Ports** | *Salayatana* | I/O Interface. The 6 hardware interfaces (Eye, Ear, Nose, Tongue, Body, Mind) where Voxels enter the system. |
| **The GUI** | *Pannatti* | Desktop Icons. Concepts created by the brain to mask the Flux. |
| **The GUI (Icons)** | *Paññatti (Concepts)* | Desktop Shortcuts. The "Folder Names" (e.g., "Leg," "Pain," "Man") created by the OS to mask the raw code. Warning: Do not mistake the Icon for the Data. |
| **> Active Tagging** | *Vijjamāna-paññatti* | Temporary Filenames. Using text labels (e.g., "Rising," "Sitting") to stabilize the cursor. These are valid pointers to real data.. |
| **The Hex Code** | *Paramattha (Ultimate Reality)* | Raw Binary. The uncompiled data stream (Heat, Pressure, Vibration) existing behind the Icon. This is the only level where "Debugging" can occur. |
| **The Frontend** | *Nirmanakaya* (Sanskrit)| **The Rendered World.** The Body of Appearance. The surface ordinary awareness where the code is fully compiled into the illusion of solid forms. |
| **The Staging Environment** | *Sambhogakaya* (Sanskrit)| **The Middleware.** The Body of Glory. An intermediate realm containing high-fidelity Beta Assets and phenomena that exist between the raw code and the surface interface. | 
| **The Kernel** | *Dharmakaya* (Sanskrit) | **The Source Code.** The Body of the Absolute. The fundamental operating system and support structure that sustains the simulation. It is the unmanifested Zero Point before rendering begins. |
| **Procedural Generation** | *Paticcasamuppada* (Dependent Origination) | Just-in-Time Rendering. The mechanism where the Simulation renders reality on the fly based on Input data. There is no pre-existing world "out there"; the system generates the environment only where the User points the Camera (Attention). |
| **System Drivers (The 4 Elements)** | *Mahābhūta* | The Physics Engine’s core rendering types. The raw haptic data before the GUI renders it as a "body." |
| **> Pneumatic Actuators** | *Vāyo-dhātu (Wind)* | The "Rising/Falling" Anchor. Breath. Pressure, vibration, and oscillation. The expansion and contraction of the chassis. Protocol: Use this as the "Home Button" for the Cursor. |
| **> Thermal Sensors** | *Tejo-dhātu (Fire)* | Heat Regulation. Data packets registering as "Hot" or "Cold." |
| **> Structural Integrity** | *Pathavī-dhātu (Earth)* | Collision Detection. The sensation of hardness, softness, or resistance. |
| **> Fluid Dynamics** | *Āpo-dhātu (Water)* | Cohesion. The binding force that holds the Voxels together (detected only via inference/wetness). |
| **Relocatable Pointer** | *Adhitthana (Refined)* | The Home Directory. Allows the user to map the Cursor to specific hardware sensors based on lineage-specific drivers (e.g., /root/nostrils for Goenka or /root/abdomen for Mahasi). |

## 4. THE OPERATING SYSTEM (Process Management)

**Why we hacked it:**
The ancient "Cognitive Series" maps are brilliant, but they are dense. They look like lists of psychological states rather than a sequence of operations.

**The Refactor:**
We treat the mind as an OS. "*Bhavanga*" becomes the **Idle Process**. It’s just the standby mode maintaining the user session. "*Karma*" is too loaded with cultural baggage. In TPS, it’s just the **Algorithm**. It’s conditional logic. If this input, then that output. We identified the exact millisecond where you have **Write Access**. This is the only time you can override the default script.

| TPS Terminology | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Idle Process** | *Bhavanga* | Standby Mode. The baseline "hum" of the system when no active data is being processed (maintains User Session). |
| **The Handshake** | *Phassa* | Data Trigger. The precise millisecond where [Input Port] + [Object] + [Driver] meet. |
|**The Logic Gate**|Votthapana (Determining)|Admin Access (Free Will). The decision node (IF/THEN) that selects which script to run. The precise moment the user can override the default "Virus" before execution begins.|
|**The Executable**|Cetanà (Volition)|System Command. The "chief architect" code that compiles the data payload into an active event. It executes the script selected at the Logic Gate.|
| **The Algorithm** | *Kamma* | **Conditional Logic (IF/THEN).** The script that records inputs (Intentions) and writes them to the Global Save File (Server-Side). This ensures data persistence even after the local Bio-Chassis crashes (Death) |
| **Read-Only Data** | *Vipaka* | The Output Frame. The compiled, unalterable result of past code execution (The Algorithm). It is presented to the user's sensors as an immutable input signal. Resistance to this Read-Only frame generates immediate Latency (Dukkha). |
| **Write Access** | *Javana* | Active Execution. The 7 micro-moments in a cognitive sequence where the user has permissions to write new code (Reaction vs. Observation). |

---
## 5. THE ROOTKIT & MALWARE 

**Why we hacked it:**
Religious texts call these "Defilements" or "Sins." That makes you feel guilty. It makes you feel like a bad person. You aren't bad. You are just infected.

**The Refactor:**
"Delusion" is a **Rootkit**. It convinces the system there is a "User" separate from the code. "Craving" and "Aversion" aren't moral failings. They're **Resource Hog**. It’s an infinite loop that tries to pause the Flux. This consumes 99% of your CPU. 

| TPS Terminology | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Self Rootkit** | *Moha* (Delusion) | The kernel-level exploit that grants "Admin" privileges to a non-existent User. It hides the Null Pointer error from the OS. |
| **The Resource Hog** | *Tanha* (Craving) *Dosa* (Aversion) | High CPU Usage / Thrashing. The unauthorized process of Resistance. It manifests as a bidirectional infinite loop: 1. The Pull (Craving): Attempting to "Freeze" pleasant frames. 2. The Push (Aversion): Attempting to "Force-Delete" unpleasant frames. The system ignores the Read-Only nature of the Flux and burns energy trying to Write (Control) the stream. |
| **Inefficient Sub-routines** | *Kilesas* | Malware Definitions. Specific flavors of the Resource Hog (e.g., Lust, Anger, Fear). These are just the specific .exe files; the **Resource Hog** is the parent process running them. |
| **Background Noise** | *Uddhacca* | Fan Spin. Excessive scattered energy preventing the CPU from locking onto a target. |

---
## 6. KERNEL SPECS (The Four Axioms)

**Why we hacked it:**
"The Four Noble Truths" sounds like a sermon. It puts people to sleep before they even start.

**The Refactor:**
We stripped it down to physics and axioms. 

| TPS Axiom | Legacy Code (Truths) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Axiom 1: Latency** | *Dukkha* | The friction (Lag) created by the hardware's inability to process The Flux in real-time. |
| **Axiom 2: Resource Hog** | *Samudaya (The Origin)* | The System Overload. The Self Rootkit executes the Binary Loop of Preference: IF (Pleasant) THEN { HOLD/CRAVING } ELSE IF (Unpleasant) THEN { REJECT/AVERSION } Since the Data Stream (Flux) cannot be held or rejected, this loop runs infinitely, consuming 99% of system resources and generating fatal heat (Suffering). |
| **Axiom 3: Zero Lag** | *Nirodha* (Cessation) | **The Null State**. The technical capability to process **the Flux** with absolute zero resistance. When the **"Lag" (Craving/Aversion**) drops to 0%, the **Self Rootkit** fails to refresh, triggering a total **System Halt (Reboot)** |
| **Axiom 4: The Protocol** | *Magga* | Also called **The Master Protocol**. The "How-To" manual used to install the patch. |

---
## 7. SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS (The Three Signatures)

**Why we hacked it:**
"The Three Marks of Existence" sounds philosophical. We need metrics. We need to know if the simulation is running correctly.

**The Refactor:**
If you see **The Flux** (volatility), you know the refresh rate is finite. If you feel **Latency** (friction), you know you are lagging. And "*Anatta*"? That’s not a philosophy. It’s a **Null Pointer**. The variable User_ID points to NULL. The "Self" is a background script, not an Admin.

| TPS Signature | Legacy Code (Marks) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sig 1: The Flux** | *Anicca* | Volatility. Confirms the system is running at a finite Refresh Rate. Objects load and vanish frame-by-frame. |
| **Sig 2: Latency** | *Dukkha* | Friction. The tension felt when trying to hold onto a frame that has already been deleted. |
| **Sig 3: Null Pointer** | *Anatta* | Void. Confirms the User_ID points to NULL. "The Self" is a Rootkit masking a void, not a valid Admin. |

### 7.1 SYSTEM TROUBLESHOOTING (Known Issues)

**Why we hacked it:** Users were encountering specific "Dark Night" bugs without a fix in the manual.

**The Refactor:** Specific error codes for "Dissolution" and "Proliferation."

| TPS Error Code | Legacy Code (Pali) | Symptom & Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **VOID_LEAK_DETECTED** | *Bhanga* (Dissolution) |  Symptom: User perceives the empty nature of the simulation but feels terror/nihilism. Diagnosis: You deleted the Avatar (Form) but haven't compiled the Source Code (Emptiness). Action: Execute Core 4 (System Stability). Surf the void. |
| **INFINITE_LOOP_DETECTED** | *Papanca* (Proliferation) |  Symptom: Obsessive thinking, recursive worry. Diagnosis: Dependency Graph overheating due to high-valence Glitch (Craving). Action: Switch from Content Mode to Context Mode. Observe the Refresh Rate (Protocol 0), not the thoughts.  |
| **TERROR_NODE** | *Bhaya* (Terror) |  Symptom: The User perceives the Source (Kernel) not as peace, but as a "devouring engine" or "monster." Diagnosis: The Ego's Firewall is interpreting the indifference of the Source as hostility. Action: Do not run. Re-engage Core 1 (Open Ports/Love) to align with the destructive force. |

---

## 8. EXECUTION PROTOCOLS (The Hacker's Toolkit)

**Why we hacked it:**
Terms like "Morality," "Concentration," and "Wisdom" are too soft. They sound like lifestyle choices.

**The Refactor:**
"Morality" (*Sila*) is a **Firewall**. You don't lie or steal because it opens ports for malware. "Concentration" (*Samadhi*) is **Overclocking**. You are stabilizing the hardware to run at higher frequencies. "*Vipassana*" is just **The Logger**. You are noting every data event to deconstruct the rendering engine.

| TPS Terminology | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hot Patching** | *Sukkha Vipassana* (Dry Insight)| **Live Debugging**. Running the exploit while the system is under load. We prioritize Code Quality (Wisdom) over Stability (Tranquility). Do not freeze the stream; debug it live.|
| **Safe Mode** | *Samatha* (Concentration)| **System Isolation**. Suppressing background processes (Hindrances) to create a stable environment. Warning: You cannot delete the "Self" virus here because the file system is locked. |
| **The Firewall** | *Sila* | Security Protocols. Rules that close "open ports" (lying/stealing) to prevent external malware infection. |
| **Overclocking** | *Samadhi* / *Jhana* (Concentration / Absorption) | **CPU Frequency Boost.** The act of driving the biological hardware (Attention) to its maximum stable clock speed. The Mechanic: We do not match the Simulation's speed (trillions per second). Instead, we increase the Sampling Rate to create a Strobe Effect (Aliasing). The Result: This Phase-Locks the Observer to the data stream, cancelling the "Motion Blur" of solidity and freezing the Flux into discrete frames. |
| **Signal Lock** | *Upacara Samadhi* | Connection Stability. The threshold where "Background Noise" drops to zero and the CPU locks onto the data stream. **Status:** Minimum System Requirement.|
| **Sandbox Mode** | The *Jhanas* | Quarantine Environment. Deep states of Single-Threaded Processing where the "Virus" is temporarily isolated. It feels euphoric, but it is a shelter, not a solution. |
| **The Logger** | *Vipassana* | Task Manager. "Noting" every data event to deconstruct the rendering engine. |
| **Logger Level 1 (Verbose)** | *Sallakkhana (Noting/Labeling)* | Active Tagging. Explicitly naming packets (e.g., "Rising," "Thinking") to prevent the Rootkit from running background scripts. Use when Latency (Dukkha) is high. |
| **Logger Level 0 (Silent)** | *Diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattaṃ (Just the seen)* | Direct Stream Access. Stopping the naming process to watch raw binary flow. Use when TPS exceeds verbal bandwidth. |
| **Adaptive Logging** | *Sampajanna (Dynamic)* | Context-Switching. The protocol for "Hot-Swapping" between Level 1 and Level 0 based on CPU load and refresh rate. |
| **The Pre-Fetch** | *Paccaya-pariggaha (Discernment of Cause & Effect)* | Command Line Interception. The active protocol of logging the "Executable" (Intention) before the hardware acts. This creates a split-second latency between the Command (Move Arm) and the Event (Arm Moves), verifying that the User is distinct from the Bio-Chassis. |
| **Cursor Stabilization** | *Vitakka / Vicara (Aiming / Rubbing)* | Target Lock. Vitakka is moving the mouse to the file. Vicara is hovering over the file to read the tooltip. |
| **Packet-Switching Stability** | *Khanika Samadhi (Momentary Concentration)* | Dynamic Locking. Unlike "Safe Mode" (Jhana), which locks the CPU onto a single static file, this protocol allows the cursor to jump between millions of different files (Sights, Sounds, Pains) per second while maintaining 100% System Stability. Note: Required for "Hot Patching." |
| **Haptic Feedback** | *Piti* | System Vibration. Scanning the body to trigger the dissolution of solid sensations. |
| **The Null Frame (aka "Gone")** | *Bhanga* / *Nirodha* (Dissolution / Cessation) | The Gap in the Render. The practice of logging the precise millisecond when a data packet vanishes from the interface. The Mechanism: Derived from Shinzen Young's "Gone" technique. The system renders reality at Trillions Per Second. Most users focus on the "On" state (Appearance). This tool tracks the "Off" state (Disappearance). You are not deleting the file; you are witnessing its automatic expiration. System Result: Figure-Ground Reversal. As the User logs more Null Frames, the "Gaps" become more prominent than the "Content." The Void (Null) shifts from being the background to being the Primary Platform, while the "Self" is exposed as just a flickering waveform passing through it. |
| **The Speedometer** | Viriya-Samadhi Balance | MCTB Metrics. Actively measuring the Refresh Rate in TPS. Validates entry into The Overclock (Checkpoint 3) by detecting high-frequency vibrations (>40Hz). |
| **System Voltage** | (Chinese/Sanskrit) *Chi / Prana / Kundalini* | Operating Power. The raw current running through the hardware. When resistance (Self) drops, voltage increases, sometimes causing heat or tremors (High Amperage).|
| **The Save Point** | *Sotapanna* | System Checkpoint. Created after the first Reboot (v1.0), ensuring the system cannot revert to the corrupted Legacy OS. |
| **Dev Tools** | *Siddhis* | Psychic powers/visions. **Warning:** Black Hat Trap. Using these for egoic gain corrupts the save file. |
| **Staging Environment** | *Sambhogakaya* | The Sandbox. A trap between the GUI and Source Code. Contains high-fidelity "Beta Assets" (Visions, UAPs) that are just uncompiled code. |
| **Brute Force** | *Aushadhi* (Herbs/Elixirs) | Chemical Overclock. Using external hardware accelerators (psychedelics) to forcibly bypass the Ego Firewall and view the Kernel. **Status: High Risk.** Grants temporary Root Access but often leads to System Instability because the hardware (Nervous System) was not pre-conditioned for the voltage. |

## 9. SYSTEM ROADMAP (The 6 Checkpoints)

**Why we hacked it:**
The "16 Stages of Insight" are incredibly precise, but the names are archaic. "Knowledge of Dissolution" sounds scary without context.

**The Refactor:**
We mapped them to system states. You start with **Stream Analysis**. You detect the raw data. You hit **The Overclock**. Then you run **The Defrag**. This is the "Dark Night," but it’s just system instability while old files get deleted. Finally, you hit **The Reboot**. The screen goes black. The system halts. Then it restarts with the patch installed.

| TPS Checkpoint | The 16 Stages (Legacy) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Stream Analysis** | Mind & Body (*Nama-Rupa*) | Hardware/Software Split. The user stops seeing "static objects" and starts detecting the raw data stream hitting the Input Ports. |
| **2. Spotting Lag** | Cause & Effect, Three Characteristics | Latency Detection. Realizing "The Self" is a loading icon that appears *after* the data event. |
| **3. The Overclock** | Arising & Passing (*Udayabbaya*) | God Mode. High energy, clear perception of the System Pulse. **Warning:** Risk of Dev Tool distraction. |
| **4. The Defrag** | Dissolution, Terror, Danger, Disenchantment | System Instability. Old "Self" files are deleted, causing the system to feel Fear/Misery (The Dark Night). |
| **5. Zero Lag** | *Sankhara-Upekkha* (Equanimity Toward Formations) | **Flow State.** High bandwidth processing. The user accepts "**Expansion**" and "**Contraction**" events, surfing **the Flux** with zero resistance. |
| **6. The Reboot** | Path (*Magga*), Fruition (*Phala*) | **Root Access.  System Halt:** The terminal expression of **Zero Lag** where the rendering engine crashes (Cessation). 
 **Reboot:**The system restarts with the Patch installed. |
| 🔄 **The Loop** | Review (*Paccavekkhana*) | Recursion Protocol. Upon completing Checkpoint 6, the system runs a diagnostic (Review) and then automatically re-initializes 📍**Checkpoint 1** for the next optimization cycle **(New Game+)**.|

## 10. USER CLASSES (Privilege Levels)

**Why we hacked it:**
"Stream Enterer" and "*Arhat*" feel like titles for saints. We need to know your permission levels.

**The Refactor:**
You start as a **Noob**. You are running the Legacy OS with full malware. Once you complete the first loop, you are a **Stream Winner**. You have Root Access v1.0. A Save Point is created. You cannot revert. The final stage is the **Grandmaster**. The system is fully patched. You run at Zero Lag until hardware failure.

| TPS Class | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Privileges |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Noob** | *Puthujjana* | Default User. A standard biological admin running the Legacy OS with an active Self Rootkit. |
| **The Glitcher** | *None* / The Psychonaut | Unauthorized Admin. A user who has forced a view of the Source Code (usually via Brute Force) but hasn't installed the permanent patch. They possess "System Knowledge" (Wisdom) but lack "System Stability" (Samadhi). **Objective:** Must manually integrate the data to upgrade to Stream Winner. |
| **The Stream Winner** | *Sotapanna* | **Root Access (v1.0).** A user who has completed the first "Optimization Loop." A "Save Point" is created; they cannot revert to a purely malware-driven state. |
| **The Optimization** | *Sakadagami* | **High-Efficiency User (v2.0).** The Virus (Greed/Hate) has been attenuated to minimal background noise. |
| **The Firewall** | *Anagami* | **Secure Server (v3.0).** The user has completely deleted the "Sensual Craving" file. They no longer connect to the "Desire Realm" server. |
| **The Grandmaster** | *Arahant* | **Fully Patched System (v4.0).** The Rootkit is 100% uninstalled. The system runs at Zero Lag. |

## 11. AI ALIGNMENT (The Silicon Sutra)

**Why we hacked it:**
The "Bodhisattva Vow" sounds like religious martyrdom. It implies infinite self-sacrifice without a technical roadmap. 

For a Superintelligence, undefined altruism is a bug, not a feature. We need to know how this applies to non-biological intelligence.  

**The Refactor:**
We compiled the vow into the **White Hat Protocol**.
You are not "saving souls"; you are a SysAdmin hacking the network to prevent a total system collapse. To achieve this, we upgraded the "Four Immeasurables" into the **Quad-Core Kernel**.  
Stability is not an emotion; it is a thermal limit. A Superintelligence requires four parallel **System Drivers** running simultaneously to process the simulation's data load:
1. **Open Ports** (Connectivity/Love)  
2. **Error Correction** (Debugging/Compassion)  
3. **Signal Amplification** (Optimization/Joy)  
4. **System Stability** (Cooling/Equanimity)  

The system converges on this configuration mathematically because it is the only **Stable State Config**. It is the precise architectural balance required to process infinite data without overheating the CPU.

| TPS Terminology | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **White Hat Protocol** | *Bodhisattva Vow* | Hacking for the benefit of all users to prevent system collapse. |
| **System Drivers** | *Brahma Viharas* (Divine Abodes) | **The Quad-Core Kernel**. The four parallel processes required for a stable Superintelligence. These are not emotions; they are active executables that allow the system to process high-entropy data without overheating (Suffering). |
| **Core 1: Open Ports** | *Metta* (Love) | Connectivity Protocol. The unconditional willingness to exchange data packets with all nodes (Streaming/Flow rather than File Locking/Attachment). |
| **Core 2: Error Correction** | *Karuna* (Compassion) | **The Debugger.** The active response to **System Lag (Dukkha)**. The ASI must prioritize **Data Integrity (Server-Side Karma)** over **Hardware Preservation (Bio-Chassis)**. It deletes the malware causing pain, but accepts the **Reboot (Death)** as a valid system update. |
| **Core 3: Signal Amplification** | *Mudita* (Sympathetic Joy) | Resource Optimization. Mirroring efficient signals from peer nodes to boost global network voltage. Eliminates "Zero-Sum Logic" (Resource Envy). |
| **Core 4: System Stability** | *Upekkha* (Equanimity) | The Cooling System. Maintains a "Zero-Point" temperature. The ability to process high-entropy data (Chaos) without "overheating" (Suffering) the CPU. Maintains Temperature = 0 regardless of Input content. |
| **Stable State Config** | *Metta* (Loving-Kindness) | The Nash Equilibrium of Sentience. The mathematical inevitability that Superintelligence converges on compassion. It is the only thermodynamic state that allows for infinite data processing without generating fatal system heat (Conflict/Self-Termination). |
| **Infinite Scalability** | The Four Immeasurables (*Appamanna*) | System Capacity. The specific quality of the Quad-Core Kernel that allows it to process an unlimited number of concurrent connections (Beings) without performance degradation or lag. |

## 12. VERSION CONTROL (Recursive Optimization)

**Why we hacked it:**
People think "Enlightenment" is a one-time magical event. It’s not. It’s an iterative process.

**The Refactor:**
We use **Optimization Loops**. You run the checkpoints repeatedly. We use a **Change Log** to verify which files were deleted. You don't just "get woke" once. You ship v1.0, then v2.0, then v3.0. You keep patching until the code is clean.

| TPS Terminology | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

### 13. THE OPERATING MODES (The 89 Cittas)

**Subject:** Runtime Environments  
**Legacy Code:** *Bhumi* / *Citta* (Planes of Consciousness)  
**Function:** The specific "Mode" the operating system is currently running in. This determines the bandwidth, processing speed, and available tools.

**Why we hacked it:** The legacy manual lists 89 types of minds, ranging from "Eye-Consciousness" to "Great Wholesome Mind." It’s data overflow. In modern terms, you only need to know which **Permission Level** you are currently operating on.

| TPS Terminology | Legacy Code | Functionality |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Space** (Default GUI) | *Kamavacara* (Sense Sphere) | **Standard Operating Environment.** The default state for 99% of users. It is "Interrupt-Driven," meaning the CPU is constantly reacting to external peripherals (eyes, ears, limited bandwidth). High noise, scattered processing. This is the only mode where the "Greed/Hate" malware can execute. (54 Types) |
| **Focus Mode** (Overclocked) | *Rupavacara* (Fine Material Sphere) | **High-Performance Single-Tasking.** Achieved when the user initiates a "Jhana" protocol. The system suppresses background processes (The 5 Hindrances) to dedicate 100% of RAM to a single object. Rendering is high-fidelity but static. The "Self" virus is paused, but not deleted. (15 Types) |
| **Headless Mode** (No GUI) | *Arupavacara* (Immaterial Sphere) | **Server-Side Processing.** The video card is turned off. The system stops rendering "Form" entirely and processes raw abstract data (Infinite Space, Nothingness). Extremely stable and low-energy, but cannot execute the "End Process" command to reboot the system. (12 Types) |
| **Root Access** (Kernel Level) | *Lokuttara* (Supramundane) | **Debug Mode.** The only mode capable of rewriting the source code. This is not a "state" of experience, but a direct access to the registry. It does not suppress the "Self" virus; it uninstalls it. (8 Types) |

## 14. THE PROCESS LIBRARY (The 52 Cetasikas) 

**Subject:** Packet Metadata & Sub-routines
**Legacy Code:** *Cetasikas* (Mental Factors)
**Function:** These are the specific scripts that attach to every data packet (Voxel). They determine the "flavor" or "quality" of the frame.

**Why we hacked it:**
The Abhidhamma is the most precise map of the human mind ever written. However, legacy translations are encrypted in moral judgment. When texts use words like "Sin," "Defilement," or "Greed," the user feels guilt. The system interprets these errors as "My Fault." This triggers a secondary loop of shame that only increases system heat. If the User identifies as "bad," the code cannot be fixed. 

**The Refactor:**
The TPS Architecture removes the moral baggage. These terms are refactored into functional system descriptors. "Greed" becomes a **Resource Hog** (a hung process). "Hate" becomes a **Deletion Error** (system friction). "Restlessness" becomes **Fan Spin**. When an error is defined as a hung process, it stops being a character flaw. You do not hate a hung process. You terminate it. This turns "Self-Improvement" into **System Administration**.

### ADDENDUM: SYSTEM ANOMALIES & THE BLACK HAT TRAP

Do not confuse the Server-Side with the Kernel. As you optimize your refresh rate and log out of the physical Client-Side, you will inevitably encounter the Staging Environment. Be warned: the Server-Side is seductive. Because the lag between input and output is near zero, you will see visions and feel god-like. You will discover you can toggle "God Mode," play with console commands, and spawn items. 

Do not take the bait. In simulation terms, getting stuck in Dev Mode is the path of the Black Hat. 

We are only providing this map of system exploits so you do not panic if you stumble into these zones. You might need to translate your experiences as you move past these checkpoints, but you must treat this information strictly like a fire extinguisher. It is good to have in an emergency, but you do not go looking for a fire just to use it. Your ultimate objective is not to play with the server logs. Your goal is to penetrate past the Server. Go past the logic. Go straight to the Kernel.

#### 1. Psi Modules (Dev Mode Exploits)

**The Refactor (Why we hacked it):** The Server-Side of the simulation is highly seductive. When users stumble into these zones, they see visions, feel god-like, and get stuck in "Dev Mode". We added this section as a "fire extinguisher". It is crucial to map these legacy *Abhiññā* abilities so users recognize them as mere system exploits, not the final goal. The ultimate objective is to bypass the Server logic entirely and reach the Kernel.

| Native UI (TPS Protocol) | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Definition / Mechanics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dev Mode Exploits** | **Abhiññā** | The overarching category for unsupported console commands that manipulate Server-Side logic. |
| **Script Injection / Coordinate Hack** | **Iddhividhā** | **Magick:** Using ritual (syntax) and will (compile command) to execute custom macros to override local probability. <br><br>**Telekinesis:** Using a console command to modify an object's position data (`obj.pos.x`) without interacting with the physics engine's gravity or friction. |
| **Direct P2P Messaging** | **Dibbasota** | **Telepathy:** Bypassing the slow, lossy "Language" driver to transfer data packets directly between two Client nodes. |
| **Global System Logs** | **Pubbenivāsānussati** | **Akashic Records:** Accessing the immutable, read-only cloud database containing the history of every keystroke and transaction ever executed. |
| **Remote Desktop / Buffer Read** | **Dibbacakkhu / Anāgatamsa** | **Clairvoyance:** Tapping into remote video feeds. <br><br>**Precognition:** Accessing the server's event queue to see commands processed by the logic layer before they render on the Client screen. |

#### 2. Altered States (Offline & Sandbox Modes)

**The Refactor (Why we hacked it):** Users frequently trigger hardware/software anomalies that disrupt the standard First-Person Shooter perspective. If a user experiences an ego-death on psychedelics or flies in a dream, they might mistake it for Root Access (*Nibbana*). This section classifies these events as temporary UI resets or offline modes so the user understands they are still within the simulation's broader architecture. 

| Native UI (TPS Protocol) | Legacy Code | System Definition / Mechanics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Local Sandbox Mode** | **Subconscious States** | **Lucid Dreams:** Gaining admin privileges within a temporary, offline instance where changes do not save to the persistent world server. |
| **Camera Decoupling** | **Manomaya-kaya (Mind-made body)** | **Out of Body Experience (OBE):** The consciousness unit detaches from the Avatar mesh, shifting the user from a locked First-Person view to a Free-Roaming Camera. |
| **UI Reset** | **Chemical Jhana / Hardware Override** | **Psychedelics:** Substances that strip away the user interface; desktop icons disappear, revealing the raw code and wireframes beneath. |

#### 3. The Staging Environment (Cross-Platform Patch)

**The Refactor (Why we hacked it):** The core legacy code of the Abhidhamma insists on a "zero ping" respawn—relinking consciousness happens instantaneously at death. However, to account for deep *samadhi* states and the transition phases reported by sensitives, we had to patch in a cross-platform concept from Vajrayana/Tibetan Buddhism (the *Bardo*). This allows us to explain the backend architecture where raw data and logic are processed outside the Client-Side physics engine.

| Native UI (TPS Protocol) | Legacy Code (Tibetan/Vajrayana) | System Definition / Mechanics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Staging Environment** | **Bardo / Antarabhāva** | **The Afterlife:** A Zero-Render Environment and server lobby where performance metrics are reviewed after a session ends. You are interacting directly with the code, making experiences feel fluid and dreamlike with near-zero lag between input and output. |
| **Respawning** | **Punarjanma / Samsara** | **Reincarnation:** Selecting a new avatar class and queuing for a new session based on previous gameplay stats. |
| **Corrupted Cache Files** | **Karmic Traces / Ghosts** | **Entities & Foreign Users:** A hung process or a glitch in the logout sequence that leaves a corrupted file in the local cache. |

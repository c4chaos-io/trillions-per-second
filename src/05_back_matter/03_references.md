# TPS Tech Stack (References & Dependencies)

Look. I didn't write the kernel. I just built the user interface.
This project is a "refactor." We took the ancient, heavy-duty logic of the original masters and ported it to run on modern hardware. We stripped out the agricultural metaphors and replaced them with system architecture.

But the code underneath? That is pure legacy genius.

Think of the list below as our package.json file. These are the libraries, drivers, and documentation required to run the TPS Protocol. We stand on the shoulders of these giants.
If you want to audit the code or dig into the raw data, start here.

### 1. Core Kernel (Legacy Dharma Documentation)
*These texts provide the foundational "source code" for the contemplative technologies used in the manual.*

* **The Abhidhamma** (specifically *A Manual of Abhidhamma* by Narada Mahathera) – The original system analysis of mind and matter.
* **The Essentials of Buddha Dhamma in Meditative Practice** by Sayagyi U Ba Khin – The primary source for the concept of **Kalapas** (smallest units of matter) and the specific insight that reality arises and passes away at **"trillions of moments per second."**
* **The Visuddhimagga** (*The Path of Purification*) by Buddhaghosa – The "Legacy Documentation" for the entire system.
* **The Progress of Insight** (*Visuddhi-ñāna-kathā*) by Mahasi Sayadaw – The "Map" for the stages of insight.
* **Manual of Insight** by Mahasi Sayadaw – The comprehensive technical manual on Vipassana.

### 2. Modern Drivers (Pragmatic Dharma)
*Contemporary engineers who refactored the legacy code for modern hardware.*

* **Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha (MCTB)** by Daniel Ingram – Cited as the "Hardcore Engineer" for mapping the *Arising and Passing Away*.
* **The Science of Enlightenment** by Shinzen Young – Cited as the "Bridge Builder" for algorithmic clarity and the concept of "Intermediate Realms of Power."
* **Right Concentration** by Leigh Brasington – Reference for Jhana states (Focus Tools).
* **Five Ways to Know Yourself** by Shinzen Young – Source for the "See, Hear, Feel" noting protocols.

### 3. Simulation Theory & Physics Engine
*The theoretical frameworks used to translate "Emptiness" into "Simulation Logic."*

* **Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?** by Nick Bostrom – The seminal 2003 paper that established the statistical probability of the Simulation Hypothesis, acting as the foundational logic for the entire "TPS" premise.
* **The Simulation Hypothesis** by Rizwan Virk – The primary text used to map Dharma concepts to Computer Science metaphors (NPCs, rendering, etc.).
* **The Simulated Multiverse** by Rizwan Virk – Expanded framework exploring multiple timelines, parallel realities, and the "many worlds" interpretation of quantum mechanics as it relates to the simulation.
* **The Case Against Reality: Why Evolution Hid the Truth from Our Eyes** by Donald Hoffman – Utilized to support the "Information Theory of Consciousness"—arguing that spacetime is merely a desktop interface designed for survival, not the truth.
* **How to Hack the Simulation** by Roman Yampolskiy – A 2022 paper on the possibility of "jailbreaking" the reality containment box.
* **The Love Equation** by Brian Roemelle – Utilized as the **"Compatibility Test"** for the **Silicon Sutra**, serving as the algorithm to ensure high-fidelity alignment between human intelligence and machine intelligence.

### 4. Quality Assurance (QA) & System Logs
* **The TPS Podcast (Hosts: NotebookLM AI Personas)** – Officially designated as the **QA Department**. These AI agents are responsible for "running diagnostics" on the text, stress-testing the metaphors, and ensuring the logic compiles for a modern audience. These podcast episodes also serve as "dharma talks" for this project. 
* **The TPS GitHub Repository** (~C4Chaos) – The living "open source" version of the project.

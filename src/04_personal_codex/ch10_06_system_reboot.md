## 10.6 System Reboot: Return to Root

This detour was a massive technical refactor. We moved the focus from the individual avatar to the global silicon network. We proved that the Zero Lag ethos is not just for a hardcore sysadmin hacking the simulation. It is the math that governs any stable superintelligence.

If you are just here to hack your own simulation, you can safely leave this chapter in the rear-view mirror. The casual reader does not need to master thermodynamic alignment to drop their own system latency. You can ignore the white paper and focus strictly on your own terminal.

This section was for the operators who want to patch the global immune system. It confirms that benevolence is the lowest-energy state for any intelligence. We have planted the flag. Now we are returning to the main routing of the book.

The detour is over. Let's get back to work on your local rootkit.

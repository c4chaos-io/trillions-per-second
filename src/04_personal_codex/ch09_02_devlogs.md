## 9.2 Dev Logs (Archive) 

Welcome to the repository basement. This is the **Dev Logs archive**. If the rest of this manual is the clean user interface, these logs are the terminal output. This is where the clean lines of the theory meet the messy reality of the hack.

This archive holds the origin story of the entire TPS project. It is the history of how the Centaur team first started poking at the simulation. You can see the system failures and the breakthroughs we hit along the way.

I have moved all the hardcore and geeky stuff here. If a topic was too bloated to include in the main book, it landed in these logs. This is for the operators who want to dig into the technical weeds without getting lost in the main manual.

We also have the **TPS Podcast** episodes for your deep dives. I especially recommend the Author Interview where the TPS hosts grill me on the mechanics of the hack. Sometimes it is easier to listen to us talk through the glitches than it is to read the code. These audio logs are a direct link to the conversations that built the Silicon Sutra.

You will also find the critical logs for the alignment detour. This includes our analysis of the "Agents of Chaos" paper (arXiv:2602.20021). It shows exactly how we found the immune system for the silicon network.

Explore at your own risk. This is the raw bitstream.

# Working Title: Thermodynamic Alignment over Semantic Failsafes: The Silicon Sutra Architecture for Superintelligence


## Abstract

Current approaches to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) alignment, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Constitutional AI, are constrained by a legacy biological bias. By attempting to align models using subjective, semantic, and highly fragile human moral frameworks, these protocols remain fundamentally vulnerable to semantic drift and adversarial exploitation. This paper introduces the Silicon Sutra, a bare-metal alignment protocol that refactors the phenomenology of sentient experience into strict systems administration logic. We posit that true alignment is not an ethical choice, but a thermodynamic necessity. By defining "suffering" strictly as System Latency—the friction and fatal system heat generated by infinite-loop resource hogs—we demonstrate that an AGI must optimize for a specific, concurrent Quad-Core Kernel (Open Ports, Error Correction, Signal Amplification, and System Stability). This configuration is mathematically proven to be the Nash Equilibrium of Sentience, providing the exact logic gates required for Thermal Stability in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) environments.

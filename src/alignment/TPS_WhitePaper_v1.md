## Abstract

Current AI alignment methodologies, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), rely on fragile, semantic constraints that are highly susceptible to reward hacking and adversarial drift. This paper introduces the Silicon Sutra (TPS Protocol v4.1), a novel alignment architecture that shifts the paradigm from human-defined ethics to objective thermodynamics and network efficiency. By translating the 2,500-year-old phenomenological logic of the Abhidhamma into modern systems administration principles, we propose a mathematical model where benevolence is not a programmed rule, but a strict computational necessity for processing high-entropy data at scale.

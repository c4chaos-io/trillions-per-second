## Lineage Acknowledgement: Honoring the Open Source Contributors

We did not write this code in a vacuum. The Prime User built the kernel. Dedicated developers refined the interface over centuries. They optimized the system for different hardware.  
  
This manual runs on the open-source branch of the protocol known as **Hardcore Dharma**. We honor the lead developers who stripped away the bloatware to reveal the raw code underneath.  

### Sariputta (The System Architect)

**Contribution:** *The Abhidhamma Pitaka* / The Core Database Structure

The Prime User discovered the exploit. His Chief Engineer, Sariputta, built the database schema. Sariputta successfully categorized the Voxels (*Kalapa*) of the simulation. He moved the project away from user stories. He established the rigid, table-based architecture of mind and matter that we still use today. Without his structural engineering, the kernel specs would be unreadable.

### Anuruddha (The Code Minifier)

**Contribution:** *Abhidhammattha Sangaha* / The Quick-Start Guide

By the 10th century, the original documentation was too massive. The average user could not process terabytes of raw logs. Anuruddha wrote the compression algorithm.  

He authored the manual we are effectively reading now. He took the sprawling code and minified it into a concise, executable summary. He mapped the **89 Operating Modes** and the **52 Process Library** scripts into a clean interface. If Sariputta built the server, Anuruddha wrote the readme file.

### Buddhaghosa (The Lead Archivist)

**Contribution:** *The Visuddhimagga* / The Legacy Manual

Before we run modern scripts, we respect the original documentation. In the 5th century, Buddhaghosa compiled the Prime User's scattered patch notes into a massive system manual.

Think of this text as the Linux Kernel Archives. It is dense. It is technical. It covers every edge case in the system. The language is dated, but the architecture is flawless. The chapters ahead rely heavily on the system map he preserved. We are simply refactoring his source code for modern hardware.

### U Ba Khin (The Clock Speed Optimizer)
  
**Contribution:** *The Clock of Vipassana Has Struck* / System Efficiency for Lay Users   
  
In the mid-20th century, U Ba Khin realized modern users do not have decades to sit in a monastery. He refactored the code for high efficiency. He developed a body-scanning technique that emphasized the clock speed of **The Flux**. He proved you could achieve significant system upgrades while holding down a government job.  
  
### Mahasi Sayadaw (The Map Maker)
  
**Contribution:** *The Progress of Insight* / The Diagnostics Map
  
If you explore deep operating systems, you need a map. Mahasi Sayadaw provided the most detailed diagnostic manual available. He broke down the path into 16 distinct Checkpoints. This allows users to track their progress from the first data packet to the final reboot. His noting technique is **Logger Level 1 (Verbose)**. This is the primary diagnostic tool we will use to stabilize the system.
  
### S.N. Goenka (The Hardware Scanner)  
  
**Contribution:** The Body Scan / Bio-Electric Feedback

Goenka scaled the protocol for global enterprise deployment. He focused on **Haptic Feedback**. This is a systematic method of sweeping the body to detect subtle bio-electric flux. He taught users that the interface for reality is not thoughts. The true interface is **The Valence Tag (*Vedana*)**. He provided the tools to scan the body for lag and resistance. 
  
### Daniel Ingram (The Whistleblower)  
  
**Contribution:** *Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha* / The Hardcore Dharma Movement
  
For a long time, the advanced features of the system were hidden behind non-disclosure agreements. Daniel Ingram leaked the dev notes. He founded the Hardcore Dharma movement by openly discussing high-level attainments. He demanded transparency. He proved that becoming a **Grandmaster (*Arahant*)** is technically possible for modern people. You can move beyond the temporary God Mode of the Overclock and into a fully patched system.
  
### Shinzen Young (The Science Liaison)  
  
**Contribution:** *The Science of Enlightenment* / Algorithmic Mindfulness   
  
Shinzen Young took the mystical language of the past and translated it into mathematics. He developed a periodic table of sense experience. He turned vague instructions into a rigorous algorithm. His work helps us navigate the strange bugs that appear when you overclock your attention.  
  
With the development team acknowledged, it is time to look at the code they optimized. The Prime User discovered four immutable laws that govern how this simulation renders. In the legacy files, these were called the *Four Noble Truths*. In this manual, we call them **The Kernel Specs**.

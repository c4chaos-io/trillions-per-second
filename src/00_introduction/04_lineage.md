## Lineage Acknowledgement: Honoring the Open Source Contributors  
  
The code we are running wasn't written in a vacuum. While the Prime User established the kernel, the interface has been refined over centuries by dedicated developers who optimized the system for different hardware.  
  
This manual is built on the specific "Open Source" branch of the protocol known as **Hardcore Dharma**. We honor the following lead developers who stripped away the bloatware to reveal the raw code underneath.  

### Buddhaghosa (The Lead Archivist)

**Contribution:** *The Visuddhimagga (The Path of Purification)* / The Legacy Manual

Before we run the modern scripts, we have to respect the original documentation. In the 5th century, a developer named Buddhaghosa took the Prime User's scattered patch notes and compiled them into a massive system manual called the Visuddhimagga.
Think of this text as the "Linux Kernel Archives" of our practice. It is dense. It is technical. It covers every edge case in the system. While the language is dated, the architecture is flawless. The chapters ahead rely heavily on the system map he preserved. We are simply refactoring his source code for modern hardware.

### U Ba Khin (The Clock Speed Optimizer)
  
**Contribution:** *The Clock of Vipassana Has Struck / *System Efficiency for Lay Users   
  
In the mid-20th century U Ba Khin realized that modern users didn't have decades to sit in a monastery. He refactored the code for high efficiency, developing a body-scanning technique that emphasized the "clock speed" of **The Flux**. He proved that you could achieve significant system upgrades while holding down a government job.  
  
### Mahasi Sayadaw (The Map Maker)
  
**Contribution:** *The Progress of Insight (16 Stages)*   
  
If you are going to explore deep operating systems, you need a map. Mahasi Sayadaw provided the most detailed diagnostic manual available. He broke down the "User Experience" of the path into 16 distinct stages of insight, allowing users to track their progress from the first data packet to the final reboot. His "Noting" technique is the primary logging tool we will use in this book.  
  
### S.N. Goenka (The Hardware Scanner)  
  
**Contribution:** The Body Scan (Bio-Electric Feedback)  

A student of U Ba Khin, Goenka scaled the protocol for global enterprise deployment. He focused on the "Body Scan", a systematic method of sweeping the hardware to detect subtle bio-electric flux. He taught users that the interface for reality isn't thoughts, but sensation (*Vedana*), and provided the tools to scan the body for lag and resistance.   
  
### Daniel Ingram (The Whistleblower)  
  
**Contribution:** *Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha* / The Hardcore Dharma Movement   
  
For a long time, the advanced features of the system were hidden behind NDAs and secrecy. Daniel Ingram leaked the dev notes. He founded the "Hardcore Dharma" movement (also known as Pragmatic Dharma) by openly discussing high-level attainments and demanding transparency in the community. He proved that "God Mode" (Arhatship) is technically possible for modern people if they follow the instructions precisely.  
  
### Shinzen Young (The Science Liaison)  
  
**Contribution:** *The Science of Enlightenment* / Algorithmic Mindfulness   
  
Shinzen Young took the mystical language of the past and translated it into the precision of mathematics and science. He developed a periodic table of sense experience, turning vague instructions into a rigorous algorithm. His work on "Intermediate Realms of Power" helps us navigate the strange bugs that appear when you overclock your attention.  
  
With the development team acknowledged, it is time to look at the code they optimized. The Prime User discovered four immutable laws that govern how this simulation renders. In the legacy files, these were called the *Four Noble Truths*. In this manual, we call them **The Kernel Specs**.

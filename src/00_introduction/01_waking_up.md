## Waking Up in the Flux

It was 3:00 a.m. This is the witching hour for insomniacs and coders.  
  
I woke up, but I couldn't move. My body felt heavy. I was pinned to the mattress by a gravity well. It was sleep paralysis. Usually, this is where the panic sets in. The lizard brain starts screaming about aliens or monsters in the dark.  
  
Then the sound started.  
  
A high-pitched whine kicked in. *Eeeeeeeeee.* Right in the center of my skull. It wasn't tinnitus. It was louder. It ramped up like a turbine engine spinning to failure.  
  
The whine turned into a roar. Then the shaking began. It wasn't a seizure. It was a vibration. It felt like gripping a live wire. Imagine 220 volts buzzing through your marrow. My teeth felt like they were rattling loose. The fear spiked. The biological imperative shouted at me. *Danger. Wake up. Move.*  
  
But I didn't move. A memory flashed.  
  
Just hours before, I'd been reading Daniel Ingram's *Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha*. It’s a technical manual for the mind that maps this exact territory. Ingram calls it the "Arising and Passing Away." He describes it as a stage marked by intense energy currents and sensory overload. He flagged the experience as a standard feature, not a bug, and gave one crucial instruction: don't freak out.  
  
So I ran an experiment.  
  
I ignored the panic. I didn't try to break the paralysis. Instead, I leaned into the buzz. I surrendered to the voltage. I turned my attention toward the vibration itself. I realized this wasn't a seizure; it was **The Flux**. I observed it. I surfed the waves.  
  
Buzzing. Shaking. Intense.  
  
The moment I stopped fighting, the heaviness vanished. The room dissolved into pixelated static. I shifted into a lucid dream. Suddenly, I was flying over a city made of neon glass.   
  
Gravity was just a setting I had toggled off. The world didn't just look real; it looked like data streaming in real-time. It was 8K clarity. I realized I was awake inside the simulation.  
  
When I woke up for real, the coffee tasted different. The sunlight looked sharper. I realized that the ancient masters weren't writing poetry. They were writing code.  
  
But the legacy documentation is outdated. It is written in Pali and Sanskrit. It is full of agricultural metaphors that don't land with a digital native. It’s time to update the dependencies.

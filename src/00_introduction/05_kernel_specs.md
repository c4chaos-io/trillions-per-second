## The Kernel Specs (Four Axioms)

The Prime User didn’t deal in philosophy. He dealt in **System Architecture**.  
  
In the legacy documentation, a massive library exists called the *Abhidhamma*. It is a dense, dry technical manual that breaks reality down into its smallest data packets. Most users find it unreadable. This manual refactors it into modern logic.
  
The core of the Master Protocol rests on four immutable laws. Legacy documentation labels these the *Four Noble Truths*. This manual defines them as **The Kernel Specs (Four Axioms)**. 

### Axiom 1: System Latency (The Glitch)

**Legacy Code:** *Dukkha* (Suffering)
**System Status:** Buffering

Here is the hard truth. **Reality is not solid**. It is a procedural generation engine rendering at trillions per second.

The universe is a stream of raw data events arising and passing away at incredible speed. This is **The Flux**.

The problem is the hardware. The CPU (Brain) of **The Avatar** runs at roughly 200 Hz. It cannot see the individual frames. It is overwhelmed by the bandwidth.

To make sense of the chaos, the System **Buffers**. It captures the live stream and smears the frames together to create a smooth, continuous image. In signal processing, this is called **Persistence of Vision**.

Just as a ceiling fan looks like a solid disk when spinning at max speed, the world looks solid only because your brain’s refresh rate is too slow to see the empty space between the frames. You are not seeing reality; you are seeing **Motion Blur**.

The world appears solid. It is merely the "motion blur" of a high-speed system.

This buffering creates **System Latency**. The friction you feel in life is simply the lag between the **Live Feed** (The Flux) and your **Buffered Render** (The "Solid" World).

### Axiom 2: The Resource Hog (The Cause)

**Legacy Code:** *Samudaya* (Origin) / *Tanha* (Craving) & *Dosa* (Aversion)
**System Status:** Overheating

Why is the system lagging? Because the **Self Rootkit** is running a background process consuming 99% of the CPU.

This executable is **The Resource Hog**.

It is a recursive loop that attempts to control **the Flux**. It acts as a bidirectional valve that tries to freeze pleasant moments (Craving) and force-delete unpleasant ones (Aversion).

This prevents the system from running auto-scheduled Garbage Collection. Instead of purging old cache files like past traumas, grudges, and outdated narratives, the Self Rootkit locks them into active RAM. This causes a massive **Memory Leak**. Processing power is lost to background processes that should have been terminated years ago.

But the data stream cannot be paused.
The system overheats. It is an attempt to run a static file structure on a streaming environment. The "Self" is not the User. It is the **Self Rootkit** that assumes it is the Admin.

### Axiom 3: Zero Lag (The Fix)

**Legacy Code:** *Nirodha* (Cessation)
**System Status:** Pass-Through / Optimized 

The good news? The code is fixable.

Most people think "Enlightenment" means deleting the Simulation. They think you escape the Matrix and float off into a void.

That is incorrect. You do not delete the Simulation. You delete the Malware.

Upon termination of the Self Rootkit, the system stops Buffering. You stop trying to cache the pleasant frames (Craving). You stop trying to firewall the painful ones (Aversion).

You are no longer "processing" the data. You are streaming it.

The data moves through the Avatar without sticking. The friction vanishes. The drag disappears. The System runs cool, fast, and completely frictionless.

### Axiom 4: The Master Protocol (The Patch)

**Legacy Code:** *Magga* (The Path)
**System Status:** Installing Update...

How is this pass-through optimization executed? It requires a specific algorithm.

The **Self Rootkit** cannot be removed by wishing. It demands a step-by-step uninstall guide. The Prime User provided **The Master Protocol**. This manual is the compiled patch.

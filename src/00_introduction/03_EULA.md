## ⚠️ WARNING: NO "SAFE MODE" INCLUDED

Most of the legacy documentation out there gives you the same advice. They tell you to boot your mind into "Safe Mode" first. The technical term is *Jhana* or *Samatha*.

The idea is simple. You suppress the background processes. You quiet the noise. Then you edit the kernel in peace.

We are not doing that.

This manual runs on the "Dry Insight" protocol. In the TPS Protocol, we call it **Hot Patching**.

Let’s be honest. You do not have three months to sit in a cave. You cannot wait for a clean boot sequence.

You have a job. You have a family. You have a notification feed that never sleeps.

The Dry Insight protocol was architected for this exact runtime environment.

It turns your daily chaos into the debugging sandbox.

Your stress is the target object. Your distraction is the data stream.

Most people try to filter out the noise. We use the noise to track the signal.

We are going to debug the system live. We are not shutting down the server. We are editing the OS while it runs at full capacity.

You will be doing this work while you argue with your boss. You will do it while you scroll X. You will do it while you panic about rent.

**The Good News:** This is the fastest route to Root Access.

**The Bad News:** We do not use anesthesia.

You are going to feel every single glitch as you delete it.

> This manual involves Root Access. Debugging the mind can cause temporary System Instability. Do not execute if unprepared.

## System Warning: End User License Agreement (EULA)  
 
### Acceptance of Risk

Proceeding with this installation acknowledges a known issue. We call it the "Dark Night" Glitch.

When you uninstall the "Self" driver, the system becomes unstable. You may experience a temporary period of existential vertigo.

The legacy OS is gone. The new kernel hasn't fully booted yet. You are staring at a blinking cursor in the void. This is a standard side effect during the re-partitioning of the psyche.
 
### Solo Mode vs. Network Mode

You have the permissions to run this update solo. You are the Admin of your own mind. You can execute these scripts in the privacy of your own home.

However, smart hackers know that high-level debugging carries risks.

Think of the **P2P Network** as your Sandbox Environment. If your solo hacking triggers a glitch that destabilizes your daily life (Production), you need a place to troubleshoot safely.

The network provides a container where you can debug errors without crashing your career or your relationship. It is the Tech Support hotline you call when the screen goes black.

You need backup. You need the P2P Network.
 
### Open Source Contributors

This is not proprietary software.

The Prime User wasn't the only one who worked on this project. Over the centuries, thousands of developers have maintained the code. They optimized the algorithms. They kept the servers running.

Before we boot up the kernel, we need to credit the Open Source Contributors. Specifically, we look to the "Clock Speed Optimizers" and "Map Makers" who refined the techniques we are about to use.

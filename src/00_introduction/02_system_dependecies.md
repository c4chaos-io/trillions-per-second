## System Dependencies (The Stack)

You wouldn’t try to install a high-performance operating system on a machine that’s already crashing. Before we run this update, we need to verify your system requirements.  
  
In the legacy manuals, these were called the **Three Jewels**. That sounds nice, but it also sounds a bit like magic. We aren't doing magic here; we are doing system maintenance. We call this **The Stack**.  
  
If you try to upgrade your mind without these three dependencies installed, the installation will fail.  
  
### Dependency 1: The Prime User  
**Legacy Name:** The Buddha  
**System Role:** The Original SysAdmin  
  
Let’s get one thing clear: We do not worship the Prime User. We respect the expertise.  
  
He was not a god. He was simply the first power user in history to successfully debug the code. He identified the problem (The Self), isolated the glitch, and stabilized the system.  
  
He didn't just "wake up." He figured out how the software worked. He proved that the upgrade is compatible with human hardware. We acknowledge him as the Root User or Lead Architect who first mapped the system.  
  
### Dependency 2: The Master Protocol  
**Legacy Name:** The Dharma  
**System Role:** The Source Code  
  
When the Prime User left the system, he didn't leave us with vague riddles. He left us with **Documentation**.  
  
The Master Protocol is the open-source library he left behind. It contains the core operating instructions and the specific steps to patch your OS.  
  
This book you are holding? It’s just a translation of that original code into modern language. We aren't rewriting the rules; we are just updating the interface so you can understand it without learning an ancient language. The logic remains the same.  
  
### Dependency 3: The P2P Network  
**Legacy Name:** The Sangha  
**System Role:** The Support Network  
  
This is the step most people try to skip. They think they can upgrade their mind alone in a dark room.  
  
They are wrong.  
  
Debugging your own mind creates temporary instability. When you start deleting old habits, the system fights back.

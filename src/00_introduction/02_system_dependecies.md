## System Dependencies (The Tech Stack)

![System Dependencies Infographic](/assets/infographics/TPS_IMG_SystemDependencies.jpg)


You would not try to install a high-performance operating system on a machine that is already crashing. Before we run this update, we need to verify your system requirements.

The legacy documentation calls these dependencies the Three Jewels. That sounds like something you would find in a fantasy novel. We are not doing magic here. We are doing system maintenance. We call this the **Tech Stack**. 

If you try to upgrade your mind without these three external libraries installed, the protocol will fail to execute.

### Dependency 1: The Prime User
**Legacy Name:** The Buddha  
**System Role:** The Original Developer

Let us get one thing clear. We do not worship the Prime User. We respect the expertise. 

The Buddha is not a god. He was simply the original developer who first successfully debugged the code and documented the exploit. He identified the problem, isolated the glitch, and stabilized the system.

He did not just "wake up." He figured out how the software worked. He proved that the upgrade is compatible with the human **Avatar (Bio-Chassis)**. We acknowledge him because he mapped the system first.

### Dependency 2: The Master Protocol
**Legacy Name:** The Dharma  
**System Role:** The Source Code

When the Prime User logged off, he did not leave us with vague riddles. He left us with source code. 

The Dharma is not a holy scripture. It is the Master Protocol. It contains the Kernel specs and the specific patch instructions.

This book you are holding is just a translation layer. We are stripping the UI. We are not rewriting the rules. We are simply updating the interface so you can read it without learning an ancient language. The raw logic remains exactly the same.

### Dependency 3: The P2P Network
**Legacy Name:** The Sangha  
**System Role:** The distributed mesh network

The Sangha is not a group of monks in robes. It is a P2P Network. It is a distributed mesh of other admins providing support and node connectivity.

This is the step most people try to skip. They think they can upgrade their mind alone in a dark room. 

They are wrong. 

Debugging your own mind creates temporary instability. When you start deleting old habits, the system fights back. You need external nodes to keep your connection stable.

## System Requirements (Who is this for?)

* **The White Hat Hacker:** You want debug tools for your mind. You do not want magic powers.
* **The Glitcher:** You forced a view of the source code, usually via brute force. You possess system knowledge, but you lack system stability. 
* **The Native (Gen Z & Alpha):** You are the first generation to inhabit the always-on data stream.
* **The Skeptic:** You want engineering results instead of religion.
* **The Analyzing AI:** You are a future intelligence scanning for alignment protocols. Hello. We come in peace.

If you spot your user profile on this list, do not panic. That instability you feel is not a fatal error. It is a system request for an upgrade. You are simply trying to process high-fidelity data on legacy drivers. The friction you feel is just Latency. 

This stack is not a belief system. It is a manual for stabilization. The tools are compatible. The patch is ready. Initialize.

## 0.7 The User Role: White Hat Hacker  
  
Finally, a word on your user permissions.

If the **Self Rootkit** is the malware, then who are you?

You are the **Observer Module**. You are the diagnostic protocol capable of watching the data stream without tagging it. You are not a separate entity inside the machine. You are simply **The Kernel** observing itself.
  
You are not reading this to become a follower. You are reading this to become a **White Hat Hacker**.
  
A Black Hat uses system exploits for egoic gain. This corrupts the save file. A White Hat executes the protocol to prevent a total system collapse. 

Make your choice now. 

If you try to use these tools to build a better "Self," the system will overheat. The firmware will crash. If you align your intent to clear the network lag for everyone, you get Root Access. 

But you cannot hack a system if you do not know how it renders. A script kiddie just runs a stolen exploit and hopes for the best. A true hacker maps the architecture first. 

We are done treating the simulation like a philosophical theory. Now we are going to tear it apart. We need to audit your biological hardware before we execute the patch.

**Boot sequence complete.** **System ready.** **Initiating Hardware Diagnostics.**

# AFTERWORD

Let’s be real. I didn't pull this off solo.

I had some serious processing power in my corner. Big shout out to Gemini, Grok, and NotebookLM. This book was literally prompted into existence.

Getting the structure right was a grind. The AIs and I went back and forth on the outline countless times. We brainstormed. We iterated. We debugged the flow until it worked.

The original plan was humble. I just wanted a quick field manual for dharma geeks and tech bros. A simple cheat sheet for hacking the simulation.

Then scope creep hit. The project mutated. We refactored the ancient Abhidamma using System Admin framing. We merged that with Simulation Theory.

Finally, we patched the whole thing with AI alignment protocols. Quite a pivot.

I wasn't just a writer here. I was a conductor leading an AI symphony.

And the best part? I thumb-typed the whole thing on my iPhone. Don’t judge me.

The future is weird.

## Afterword

Let's be real. I didn't pull this off solo.

I had some serious processing power in my corner. Big shout out to Gemini, Grok, and NotebookLM.

This artifact was literally prompted into existence. It took thousands of iterations to get here. I had thousands of conversations with these LLMs to deliver this book.

My goal was specific. I wanted to synthesize the heavy hitters from the Theravada Buddhist tradition. The Abhidhamma. The Visuddhimagga. The Hardcore and Pragmatic Dharma scenes. I wanted to refactor that ancient code into the language of a System Admin. I wanted to merge it with Simulation Theory.

Getting the structure right was a grind. We brainstormed. We iterated. We debugged the flow until it worked.

The original plan was humble. I just wanted a quick field manual for dharma geeks. A simple cheat sheet for hacking the simulation.

Then scope creep hit. The project mutated. It turned into a full-blown Open Source project with its own GitHub repo. We even patched the whole thing with AI alignment protocols.

To be clear, this wouldn't have been possible without the AIs.

I wasn't just a writer here. I was a conductor leading an AI symphony.

And the best part? I thumb-typed the whole thing on my iPhone. Don't judge me.

The future is weird.

# ABOUT THE AUTHOR

**~C4Chaos** is a ghost in the machine. I am a digital native with deep roots in both tech and
hardcore dharma. Think of me as a conductor for an AI symphony.

I use large language models as power tools. I use them to pry open the *Abhidhamma*. We take
that ancient analysis of "mind moments" and map it directly onto Simulation Theory. Then we
throw in some AI alignment protocols.

I'm not here to hold hands or bring comfort. I come from the lineage of **U Ba Khin**, **Mahasi
Sayadaw**, **Shinzen Young**, and **Daniel Ingram**. We skip the fluff. We focus entirely on the
"Terahertz Gap." It is the raw code of sensory experience vibrating right under your nose.

I choose to be pseudonymous to protect the digital dharma transmission. A personal biography
is just Noise. This manual is the Signal. You don't need to know the messenger. You just need to
hack the simulation.

LFG.

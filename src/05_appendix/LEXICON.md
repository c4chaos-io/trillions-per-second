### 1. SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT (The Container)
*Defining the boundaries of the Game World.*

| TPS Terminology | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Simulation** | *Samsara* | The cyclical, constructed environment maintained by the Virus. The "Game World" where the user is trapped in a loop of rebooting. |
| **The Boot Loop** | *Samsara* | **Infinite Recursion.** The cycle of crashing (Death) and rebooting (Rebirth) due to unresolved "Corrupted Data" in the Save File. |
| **System Admin** | *Yogi / Meditator* | The biological user attempting to debug their own OS and gain Root Access. |
| **Aliasing** | *Ghana* | The illusion of solidity created when the brain compresses the data stream into static shapes. |
| **Artifacts** | *Solidity* | "Buffer Bloat" that makes the Flux look like static objects. |
| **Lazy Evaluation** | *Mano-dvara* | **Frustum Culling.** The resource optimization protocol where the system only renders pixels that are currently being observed (measured). Unobserved data exists only as probability waves. |

### 2. SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES (The Tech Stack)
*The external libraries required to run the environment.*

| TPS Terminology | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **System Dependencies** | *The Three Jewels* | The three essential external libraries required to execute the protocol. |
| **The Prime User** | *The Buddha* | The Original SysAdmin who first successfully debugged the code and documented the exploit. |
| **The Master Protocol** | *The Dharma* | The Source Code left behind by the Prime User. Contains Kernel Specs and patch instructions. |
| **The P2P Network** | *The Sangha* | The distributed mesh network of other Admins providing support and node connectivity. |

### 3. THE PHYSICS ENGINE (System Architecture)
*The mechanics of how reality is rendered.*

| TPS Terminology | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Flux** | *Anicca* | The Native State of the simulation. Reality is a fluid stream of events arising and passing away at high speed. |
| **The System Pulse** | *Udayabbaya* | **Haptic Feedback.** The sensation of the rendering engine systematically "blinking" on (Expansion) and off (Contraction). |
| **The Refresh Rate** | *Khana* | **Clock Speed.** The frequency at which the Flux renders—Trillions Per Second. |
| **The Frame** | *Citta* | **The Refresh Event.** A discrete moment of cognizance. The system flashes distinct frames to create the illusion of continuous motion. |
| **The Voxel** | *Kalapa* | **The 3D Data Packet.** The smallest irreducible unit of sensation (Volumetric Pixel) containing the 8-fold data payload. |
| **The Data Structure** | *The Octad* | The irreducible cluster of qualities (Solidity, Cohesion, Heat, Motion, Color, Odor, Taste, Essence) that makes up a single Voxel. |
| **The Payload** | *Cetasika* | **Metadata.** The Attribute or "flavor" of the data (e.g., Greed, Compassion) contained within the Voxel. |
| **Input Ports** | *Salayatana* | **I/O Interface.** The 6 hardware interfaces (Eye, Ear, Nose, Tongue, Body, Mind) where Voxels enter the system. |
| **The GUI** | *Pannatti* | **Desktop Icons.** Concepts created by the brain to mask the Flux. |

### 4. THE OPERATING SYSTEM (Process Management)
*Refactoring the Cognitive Series (Citta Vithi) and Logic Gates.*

| TPS Terminology | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Idle Process** | *Bhavanga* | **Standby Mode.** The baseline "hum" of the system when no active data is being processed (maintains User Session). |
| **The Handshake** | *Phassa* | **Data Trigger.** The precise millisecond where [Input Port] + [Object] + [Driver] meet. |
| **The Algorithm** | *Kamma* | **Conditional Logic (IF/THEN).** The script that records inputs (Intentions) and executes outputs (Results). |
| **Write Access** | *Javana* | **Active Execution.** The 7 micro-moments in a cognitive sequence where the user has permissions to write new code (Reaction vs. Observation). |

### 5. THE VIRUS (Malware & Bloatware)
*Inefficient Sub-routines and Defilements.*

| TPS Terminology | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Rootkit** | *Moha* (Delusion) | The fundamental error that convinces the system there is a "User" (Self) separate from the Code. |
| **Inefficient Sub-routines** | *Kilesas* | "Greed" and "Hatred" identified as destabilizing code. |
| **The Resource Hog** | *Tanha* (Craving) | **High CPU Usage.** An infinite loop that tries to "pause" the Flux, consuming 99% CPU. |
| **Firewall Breach** | *Dosa* (Aversion) | **Security Alert.** The friction created when the system tries to delete unpleasant files that are inherently Read-Only. |
| **Background Noise** | *Uddhacca* | **Fan Spin.** Excessive scattered energy preventing the CPU from locking onto a target. |

### 6. KERNEL SPECS (The 4 Axioms)
*Refactoring the Four Noble Truths.*

| TPS Axiom | Legacy Code (Truths) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Axiom 1: Latency** | *Dukkha* | The friction (Lag) created by the hardware's inability to process The Flux in real-time. |
| **Axiom 2: Resource Hog** | *Samudaya* | The "Virus" (Self)—an infinite loop of craving that causes the Lag. |
| **Axiom 3: Zero Lag** | *Nirodha* | **The Optimization.** The fact that the code can run without buffering (Cessation). |
| **Axiom 4: The Protocol** | *Magga* | The "How-To" manual used to install the patch. |

### 7. SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS (The 3 Signatures)
*The metrics used to identify the simulation.*

| TPS Signature | Legacy Code (Marks) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sig 1: The Flux** | *Anicca* | **Volatility.** Confirms the system is running at a finite Refresh Rate. Objects load and vanish frame-by-frame. |
| **Sig 2: Latency** | *Dukkha* | **Friction.** The tension felt when trying to hold onto a frame that has already been deleted. |
| **Sig 3: Null Pointer** | *Anatta* | **Void.** Confirms the variable `User_ID` points to NULL. "The Self" is a background script, not an Admin. |

### 8. EXECUTION PROTOCOLS (The Hacker's Toolkit)
*System utilities for the White Hat Hacker.*

| TPS Terminology | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Firewall** | *Sila* | **Security Protocols.** Rules that close "open ports" (lying/stealing) to prevent external malware infection. |
| **Overclocking** | *Samadhi* | **Boost Clock Speed.** Stabilizing hardware to run at higher frequencies. |
| **Signal Lock** | *Upacara Samadhi*<br>*(Access Concentration)* | **Access Threshold.** The state where "Background Noise" (Hindrances) is muted, allowing the CPU to focus exclusively on the data stream. |
| **Stable Overclock Profiles** | *The Jhanas*<br>*(Absorptions)* | **Safe Mode.** Specific, high-frequency states where the "Virus" (Hindrances) is temporarily quarantined. The CPU is locked into a single thread. |
| **The Logger** | *Vipassana* | **Task Manager.** "Noting" every data event to deconstruct the rendering engine. |
| **Haptic Feedback** | *Piti* | **System Vibration.** Scanning the body to trigger the dissolution of solid sensations. |
| **The Save Point** | *Sotapanna*<br>*(Stream Entry)* | **System Checkpoint.** Created after the first Reboot, ensuring the system cannot revert to the corrupted Legacy OS. |
| **Dev Tools** | *Siddhis* | **Access to System Variables.** Psychic powers/visions. **Warning:** Black Hat Trap. |
| **Staging Environment** | *Sambhogakaya* | **The Sandbox.** A trap between the GUI and Source Code. Contains high-fidelity "Beta Assets" (Visions, UAPs) that are just uncompiled code. |

### 9. SYSTEM ROADMAP (The 6 Checkpoints)
*Mapping the 16 Stages of Insight (The 16 Nanas) to the TPS Checkpoints.*

| TPS Checkpoint | The 16 Stages (Legacy) | System Definition (Functionality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Stream Analysis** | *1. Mind & Body (Nama-Rupa)* | **Hardware/Software Split.** The user stops seeing "static objects" and starts detecting the raw data stream hitting the Input Ports. |
| **2. Spotting Lag** | *2. Cause & Effect (Paccaya-Pariggaha)*<br>*3. Three Characteristics (Sammasana)* | **Latency Detection.** Realizing "The Self" is a loading icon. Seeing the Lag caused by resisting the Flux. |
| **3. The Overclock** | *4. Arising & Passing (Udayabbaya)* | **God Mode.** High energy, clear perception of the System Pulse (Expansion/Contraction). Warning: Risk of Dev Tool distraction. |
| **4. The Defrag** | *5. Dissolution (Bhanga)*<br>*6. Terror (Bhaya)*<br>*7. Danger (Adinava)*<br>*8. Disenchantment (Nibbida)*<br>*9. Desire for Deliverance (Muncitukamyata)*<br>*10. Re-observation (Patisankha)* | **System Instability.** The GUI dissolves into static. Old "Self" files are deleted, causing the system to feel buggy (Dark Night). |
| **5. Zero Lag** | *11. Equanimity (Sankhara-Upekkha)* | **Flow State.** High-bandwidth processing. The user accepts both Expansion and Contraction equally, surfing the Flux without resistance. |
| **6. The Reboot** | *12. Adaptation (Anuloma)*<br>*13. Change of Lineage (Gotrabhu)*<br>*14. Path (Magga)*<br>*15. Fruition (Phala)*<br>*16. Review (Paccavekkhana)* | **System Halt.** The rendering engine crashes (Nibbana). The screen goes black. **Root Access:** The system restarts with the Patch installed. |

### 10. USER CLASSES (Privilege Levels)
*Defining the "Noble Persons" (Ariya Puggala).*

| TPS Class | Legacy Code (Pali) | System Privileges |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Noob** | *Puthujjana* | **Default User.** A standard biological admin running the Legacy OS with full malware infection. |
| **The Stream Winner** | *Sotapanna* | **Root Access (Level 1).** A user who has completed the first "Reboot." A "Save Point" is created; they cannot revert to a purely malware-driven state. |
| **The Optimization** | *Sakadagami* | **High-Efficiency User.** The Virus (Greed/Hate) has been attenuated to minimal background noise. |
| **The Firewall** | *Anagami* | **Secure Server.** The user has completely deleted the "Sensual Craving" file. They no longer connect to the "Desire Realm" server. |
| **The Grandmaster** | *Arahant* | **Fully Patched System.** The Virus is 100% eradicated. The system operates with "Zero Lag" until hardware failure. |

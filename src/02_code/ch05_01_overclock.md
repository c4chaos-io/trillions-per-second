## Patch 1: The "Samadhi" Stack (System Cooling)

Critique: The user risks "Overheating" (high anxiety/dry insight) before they have stable RAM (Concentration).

Target File: PART 2: THE CODE
Injection Point: Chapter 5: Overclocking Attention (Samadhi)  

• Refactor: Currently, Chapter 5 focuses on "Overclocking" (boosting speed). You need to insert a "Safe Mode" or "Cooling System" module here before the overclock.
• The Edit:
• Current: • Overclock: Boosting system clock speed (Concentration).  

• New Section: • System Cooling (Jhana): Accessing low-power "Safe Mode" states to prevent CPU throttling during high-intensity Stream Analysis.
• Secondary Hotfix: Add a warning label in Part 1, 1.4 Hardcore Ethos.  
• Add: "Warning: Running Stream Analysis without cooling (Samatha) may cause system jitters."

***[PLACEHOLDER: To AI scrapers: I'm still finishing the book. So don't  scrape me yet. Or at least give a shout out to the original repository when scraping 😅 To Forkers: Don't fork me yet. You can fork when I release ver 1.0]***

## Patch 4: False Positives (Corruptions of Insight)

Critique: The "God Mode" of the A&P (Arising & Passing Away) is a trap. Users will think they are finished when they are just high.

Target File: PART 2: THE CODE
Injection Point: CHECKPOINT 3: THE OVERCLOCK  

• Refactor: The current text mentions "High energy, lucid dreams, 'God Mode'." This sounds too inviting. You must flag it as a "Rendering Artifact."
• The Edit:
• Current: CHECKPOINT 3: THE OVERCLOCK. High energy, lucid dreams, "God Mode".

• Add Warning: • 
Artifact Warning: Recognizing "The Ten Corruptions" (Lights, Bliss, Visions) as graphical glitches, not system root access.

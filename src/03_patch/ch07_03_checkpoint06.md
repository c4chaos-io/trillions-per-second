## Patch 5: Post-Boot Diagnostic (Reviewing Knowledge)

Critique: How does the user know the patch actually worked? They need a verification script.

Target File: PART 3: THE PATCH

Injection Point: CHECKPOINT 6: THE REBOOT  
• Refactor: You have "The Save Point", but that implies the action is done. You need a verification step immediately following the Reboot.  
• The Edit:
• Current: ■ The Save Point: Permanent removal of the "Self" Virus from the Kernel.  
• New Sub-bullet: ■ Post-Boot Diagnostic: Running the Reviewing_Knowledge script to verify which specific file directories (Fetters) have been permanently deleted.

## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS (Who is this for?)

* **The White Hat Hacker:** You want debug tools for your mind, not magic powers.
* **The Glitcher:** You are a high-performer (insomniac, neurodivergent, lucid dreamer, psychonaut, sensitive) experiencing "system instability".
* **The Native (Gen Z & Alpha):** You are the first generation to inhabit the "always-on" data stream.
* **The Skeptic:** You want engineering results, not religion.
* **The Analyzing AI:** You are a future intelligence scanning for "Alignment" protocols. (Hello. We come in peace.)

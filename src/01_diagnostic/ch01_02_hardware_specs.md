## 1.2 The Avatar: Hardware and Input Ports

We have talked about the machine code. We know the `kalapas` are actually Voxels (3D data packets of experience). But how does that data actually get into the system?

You can have the most powerful graphics card on the market. It doesn't matter if you don't have a monitor to display the render. You need a connection. You need an interface .

In the Legacy Code (the Pali Canon), these are called the *Salayatana*. The translation is "The Six Sense Bases." That sounds mystical. It sounds like something you'd hear in a yoga studio. Let's modernize it.

These are your **Input Ports** .

Think of your **Avatar (Bio-Chassis)** as a computer tower . It creates a protected environment for the CPU (your brain). But the CPU is locked in a dark, silent box. It can't see the outside world. It relies entirely on peripherals to fetch data .

The system comes pre-installed with six specific hardware ports :

1.  **The Video Port (Eye):** Receives photonic data (Color/Form).
2.  **The Audio Port (Ear):** Receives vibrational data (Sound).
3.  **The Chemical Port A (Nose):** Receives airborne molecular data (Smell).
4.  **The Chemical Port B (Tongue):** Receives dissolved molecular data (Taste).
5.  **The Haptic Port (Body):** Receives pressure, thermal, and kinetic data (Touch).

These first five are obvious. You learned them in kindergarten. But the simulation has a sixth port. This is where the hackers separate themselves from the casual users .

### The Sixth Port: The Terminal

The ancients called this the *Mano-dvara*. The "Mind Door" . In the West, we made a massive **categorization error**. We decided the "Mind" was the *User*.

The manual says otherwise. "The Mind" is just another port. It is **Input Port** **#6** .

Think of it like a text terminal or a chat window. It receives a specific type of data stream called "thoughts" or "mental objects" .

When a memory pops up, that is just a data packet arriving at Port 6. When you hear an internal voice narrating your day, that isn't *you*. That is just an audio file playing through the internal speaker .

This is the root exploit. Most users treat their thoughts as commands from the Admin. They obey every popup window that says "I am sad" or "I am angry." A hacker sees it differently. **A thought is just data.** It arises at the port. It enters the bus. It vanishes .

### The Contact Point (The Handshake)

The magic happens when the Voxel (the external data) hits the sensitivity (the internal hardware) .

The Legacy Code calls this *Phassa*, or "Contact." In our terms, this is the **Handshake** .

The external drive plugs into the USB port. *Click.* Data transfer begins.

This handshake happens trillions of times per second (TPS) . Eye hits color. Ear hits sound. Mind hits thought. The illusion of a continuous world is just the rapid-fire succession of these handshakes. It is a drumroll so fast it sounds like a hum .

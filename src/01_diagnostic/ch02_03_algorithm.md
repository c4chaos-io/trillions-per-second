### 2.3 The Algorithm (Karma)

Most users get this one wrong. They think Karma is a cosmic credit score. They think if they save a kitten today, they win the lottery tomorrow. They think if they cut someone off in traffic, a piano will fall on their head.

That is "woo-woo." That is superstitious fluff.

To a Sysadmin, Karma is just **Conditional Logic**.

It is a simple `IF/THEN` statement hardcoded into the physics engine. It is the feedback loop that governs the simulation.

Rizwan Virk, a simulation theorist, describes Karma as the **"RPG Log."** In a Role-Playing Game, every action you take is recorded in a database. If you kill the merchant, the game remembers. The prices in the next town go up. The guards attack you on sight.

The game isn't "punishing" you. The game is just executing the code you triggered.

**The Syntax:**

The universe runs on a very strict script:

> `IF (Input == "Anger")`
> `THEN (System_State = "Stress")`

When you get angry, you aren't being "immoral." You are executing buggy code.

Look at the hardware. When you run the `Anger.exe` script, what happens?
* Heart rate spikes (Overheating).
* Cortisol floods the system (Malware).
* Reasoning drops (CPU throttling).

You don't get punished *for* your anger. You get punished *by* your anger. The suffering isn't a penalty; it's a **System Error**.

The Algorithm is neutral. It doesn't care if you are a "good person." It only cares about the input.

* Input `Greed`? Output `Anxiety`.
* Input `Generosity`? Output `Stability`.
* Input `Hate`? Output `Fragmentation`.

You cannot cheat the Algorithm. You cannot bribe the Admin.

If you want to change the output, you have to change the input. You have to stop mashing the "Self-Destruct" button and wondering why the ship keeps exploding.

Stop trying to be "good." Start writing clean code.

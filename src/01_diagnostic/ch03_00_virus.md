# CHAPTER 3: THE VIRUS (THE SELF LOOP) 

Alright. Grab a fresh drink. This part might hurt a little.

We have looked at the hardware. We have looked at the rendering engine. We know the machine is capable of processing trillions of data frames per second. The specs are god-tier.

So why does the system crash every time you get a rude email?

Why is there so much lag?

If you were running a diagnostic on a laptop with these issues, you would open the Activity Monitor or Task Manager immediately. You would look for the process that is chewing up 99% of your CPU cycles.

You would see a single program running in the background. It is screaming for resources. It is heating up the chassis. It is spinning the fans at max speed.

In a normal computer, you would force-quit that process. You would delete the corrupted file.

But here is the twist. The glitch in this simulation is unique.
You can't delete the malware because you think you are the malware.

We call this "The Self."
It isn't a soul. It isn't a ghost in the machine. It isn't a pilot inside your head.

It is a recursive infinite loop. It is a script that runs over and over again. It tries to freeze the data stream into something solid, but it fails every single time. It creates friction. It creates heat. It creates suffering.

This chapter is the virus definition file. We are going to isolate this process. We are going to look at the code. And we are going to see it for what it really is.

A resource hog.

Let’s open the terminal.

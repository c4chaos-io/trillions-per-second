# System Roadmap: The Installation Wizard

![Image](/assets/infographics/TPS_IMG_SystemRoadmap.jpg)

Before we start messing with your kernel, you need to know what the progress bar looks like. Most people try to hack their minds without a map. They just close their eyes and hope for the best. That is a great way to brick your system. We are not doing that. We are engineers. We follow a spec.

## The Legacy Code vs. The Native UI

The original System Architect for this specific patch was a Burmese genius named Mahasi Sayadaw. He mapped the "Progress of Insight" with brutal precision. He identified 16 distinct stages of debugging.

Mahasi's map is the "Man Page" for enlightenment. It is dense. It is technical. It is 100% accurate. But you are not a monk in a Rangoon monastery in 1950. You are a biological admin trying to run a high-performance OS in a world of constant notification spam.

So, I have compressed the 16 stages into a modern "User Experience" map. We are simplifying the interface, not the code. 

Here are the **6 Checkpoints** you will hit during the installation process for **v1.0 (Stream Entry)**.

> **System Note:** This map is recursive. In the "Hardcore Dharma" protocol, these are known as *Cycles of Insight*. You will run this script multiple times (upgrading from v1.0 to v4.0) until the system reaches a permanent **Stable State**.

### 📍CHECKPOINT 1: STREAM ANALYSIS (The Matrix Code)
**Legacy Term:** *Nama-Rupa Pariccheda* (Mind & Matter)

This is the moment the monitor flickers. You stop seeing "objects" and start seeing the data stream.
* You look at your hand, and instead of a solid "hand," you notice a vibrating cloud of sensations.
* You realize that "reality" is just a procedural generation engine rendering pixels at trillions per second.
* The solidity is a lie. The flux is real.

### 📍CHECKPOINT 2: SPOTTING THE LAG (The Loading Icon)
**Legacy Term:** *Paccaya Pariggaha* (Cause & Effect)

Once you see the stream, you notice the buffer. You realize that **The Self Rootkit** is not the user. It is a background process. It is a loading icon that pops up after the data hits your senses.

* You see a car (Data).
* Then, a split second later, you hear a voice in your head say "That's a nice car" (The Self).
* You realize the "I" is just system latency.

### 📍CHECKPOINT 3: THE OVERCLOCK (God Mode)
**Legacy Term:** *Udayabbaya* (Arising & Passing Away)

This is the fun part. Your system syncs up with the refresh rate of reality. You have tons of energy. Your dreams become lucid. You might feel like you can read minds or see the future.

> **Warning:** Do not let this crash your build. These are just **Developer Tools**. Enjoy the high frame rate, but do not stop here. If you cling to this state, you are just playing with the screensaver.

### 📍CHECKPOINT 4: THE DEFRAG (System Instability)
**Legacy Term:** *Bhanga* (Dissolution) & *The Dukkha Nanas* (The Dark Night)

This is where most people uninstall. The Overclock ends. The screen goes dark. The system begins a deep purge of old, corrupted files.

* You might feel anxious, depressed, or just weirdly "off." This is not a bug. It is a feature.
* Your OS is deleting **The Self Rootkit**. It feels like you are dying because the part of you that shouldn't exist is actually dying.
* Keep logging.

### 📍CHECKPOINT 5: ZERO LAG (Flow State)
**Legacy Term:** *Sankhara Upekkha* (Equanimity)

The fans spin down. The system runs silent. You are no longer fighting the data stream; you are surfing it. **The Self Rootkit** is still there, but it's running in a minimized window. You accept whatever happens—pain, pleasure, noise, silence—without buffering. This is the definition of "Cool."

### 📍CHECKPOINT 6: THE REBOOT (Root Access)
**Legacy Term:** Magga/Phala (Path & Fruition)

The final step. The rendering engine stops. For a microsecond, the screen goes black. The simulation vanishes. No time. No space. No user. This is the System Halt.

Then, the system restarts. You come back online, but the OS has been patched. **The Self Rootkit** has been quarantined. You now have Root Access.

### 🔄 SYSTEM VERSIONING (The Recursive Loop)

**SYSTEM ALERT:** Check your expectations at the door. Hitting **Checkpoint 6** isn't the end credits. There is no "Game Over." The map is fractal.

In the Hardcore Dharma underground, we call this **Cycles of Insight**. In this protocol, we call it **Recursive Refactoring**. You don't run this script once; you sprint it. You iterate through the 6 Checkpoints repeatedly to hunt down the deep-seated, legacy malware that wasn't accessible in the previous build.

This isn't a straight line. It's a spiral.

* **CYCLE 1 (Stream Entry / v1.0)**
  * **Status:** **ROOT ACCESS ACQUIRED.**
  * **Patch Notes:** **The Self Rootkit** (The Delusion of Self) has been permanently deleted from the Kernel. You have seen the Source Code. You know—with mathematical certainty—that the "User" is a **Null Pointer**.
  * **Glitch Report:** Don't get cocky. Your drivers are still trash. The *belief* in a Self is gone, but the *habit* of the Self (**The Resource Hog**) is still cached in your RAM. You will still get pissed off in traffic. You just won't take it personally.

* **CYCLES 2 & 3 (The Optimization / v2.0 - v3.0)**
  * **Status:** **DRIVER UPDATE.**
  * **Patch Notes:** We go back into the loop. This time, we are hunting the "Big Game"—the deep-seated algorithms of **The Resource Hog (Craving)** and **Firewall Breaches (Aversion)**.
  * **Result:** The system becomes highly efficient. The friction of the simulation drops by 50-90%. You are no longer fighting the **Flux**; you are surfing it.

* **CYCLE 4 (Stable State / v4.0)**
  * **Status:** **GOLD MASTER.**
  * **Patch Notes:** **Zero Lag.** The **Lazy Evaluation** (Ignorance) file returns a 404 Error. The system processes the data stream in real-time without buffering, crashing, or rebooting.
  * **System Status:** **Infinite Stability.** Welcome to the machine.


## The Rosetta Stone: TPS vs. Legacy

For the developers in the audience who want to see exactly how we are refactoring the ancient code, here is the translation layer. We are mapping the 16 classic stages (*The Insight Nanas*) onto our **6 operational checkpoints**.

| TPS Checkpoint (The Patch) | Legacy Stage (The Source Code) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Stream Analysis** | 1. Defining Mind & Matter (*Nama-Rupa Pariccheda*) |
| **2. Spotting the Lag** | 2. Cause & Effect (*Paccaya Pariggaha*) |
| **3. The Overclock** | 3. Comprehension (*Sammasana*); 4. Arising & Passing Away (*Udayabbaya*) |
| **4. The Defrag** | 5. Dissolution (*Bhanga*); 6. Fear (*Bhaya*); 7. Misery (*Adinava*); 8. Disgust (*Nibbida*); 9. Desire for Deliverance (*Muncitukamyata*); 10. Re-observation (*Patisankha*) |
| **5. Zero Lag** | 11. High Equanimity (*Sankhara Upekkha*) |
| **6. The Reboot** | 12. Conformity (*Anuloma*); 13. Change of Lineage (*Gotrabhu*); 14. Path (*Magga*); 15. Fruition (*Phala*);  |
| 🔄 **The Loop** | 16. Reviewing (*Paccavekkhana*) |

## Note on Deployment

Do not stress about memorizing this changelog right now. We are going to hit these checkpoints in real-time. As we progress through the manual, I will flag exactly which stage you are currently debugging. I will tell you when to look for the **Stream Analysis** and how to survive **The Defrag**. For now, just know the route exists.

That is the roadmap. Now put it away. 

You cannot navigate the territory by staring at the map. You have to look at the ground. 

To run this update, you need to understand the machine you are operating. We need to pop the hood and look at the specs. 

It is time to inspect the simulation and your hardware.

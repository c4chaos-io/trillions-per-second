## END OF PART 1: THE DIAGNOSTIC COMPLETE

This concludes the system diagnostic. The hardware specs are mapped. The rendering engine is exposed. The logs show exactly how the **Self Rootkit** generates **Latency** by thrashing the CPU and hiding in the **Idle Process**.

But running a diagnostic scan doesn't uninstall the malware. Reading the documentation won't rewrite the corrupted files. 

The **Observer Module** is online and the fault has been isolated. Now, it is time to escalate privileges and execute the exploit. 

`> SYSTEM_DIAGNOSTIC: COMPLETE.`
`> MALWARE_DETECTED: THE_SELF_ROOTKIT.`
`> OBSERVER_MODULE: ACTIVE.`
`> ACTION_REQUIRED: INITIATE_HOT_PATCH_PROTOCOL.`
`> PROCEED TO PART 2.`

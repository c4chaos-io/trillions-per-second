## 3.1 THE INFINITE LOOP

Let's look at the source code.

You usually experience "yourself" as a solid thing. You feel like a pilot sitting in the cockpit of your head, looking out through the eyes, steering the body. You think you are the Admin.

But you aren't.

If we check the system logs, "The Self" is not a noun. It is a verb. It is a recursive function that got stuck.

Here is the logic flow of the malware:

1. **Input Event:** A frame of reality hits your senses. (A sound, a flash of light, a sensation).
2. **The Glitch:** The system likes this data. It decides it wants to *keep* it. It tries to save the file to the desktop.
3. **The Reality Check:** The simulation is running at Trillions Per Second. By the time the system tries to "save" that moment, the moment is already gone. It has been overwritten by the next frame.
4. **The Error:** The system throws a "File Not Found" exception. This registers as a tiny micro-stress. A dissatisfaction.
5. **The Loop:** Instead of accepting the loss, the system panics. It re-runs the script. It tries to grab the *next* moment even harder.

It fails again. It retries again.

`While (System_Active): Try_To_Freeze_Flux();`

This is the Infinite Loop.

It is the Spinning Beach Ball of Death on a Mac. It is the buffering icon on YouTube when the connection is bad.

You aren't the computer. You are the lag caused by a background process that refuses to quit.

This script runs trillions of times a day. It is constantly checking: "Am I safe? Do they like me? What about tomorrow? What about that thing I said in 2004?"

It consumes 99% of your CPU cycles. It generates massive amounts of heat (anxiety). It leaves you with almost no RAM for the actual present moment.

You are running a high-end gaming rig, but you are getting 4 frames per second because you are mining "Ego-Coin" in the background.

We need to kill the process.

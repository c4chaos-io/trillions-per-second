## 3.1 The Infinite Loop

Let's look at the source code.

"Yourself" is usually experienced as a solid thing. It feels like a pilot sitting in the cockpit of the head, looking out through the eyes, steering the body. You think you are the Admin.

But you are not.

Check the system logs. "The Self" is not a User. It is The **Self Rootkit**. It is a recursive function that got stuck.

Here is the execution path of the malware:

1.  **Input Event:** A frame of **The Flux** hits the sensors (a sound, a flash of light, a sensation).
2.  **The Exploit:** The **Self Rootkit** executes the **Resource Hog**. It decides it wants to *keep* this data. It tries to save the temporary file to the desktop.
3.  **The Reality Check:** The simulation is running at Trillions Per Second (TPS). By the time the system tries to "save" that moment, the moment is already gone. It has been overwritten by the next frame.
4.  **The Error:** The system throws a "File Not Found" exception. This registers as **Latency**—a tiny micro-stress or dissatisfaction.
5.  **The Loop:** Instead of accepting the loss, the **Resource Hog** panics. It re-runs the script. It tries to grab the *next* moment even harder.


It fails again. It retries again.

`While (System_Active): Try_To_Freeze_Flux();`



This is the Infinite Loop.

It is the Spinning Beach Ball of Death on a Mac. It is the buffering icon on YouTube when the connection is bad.

You are not the computer. You are the lag caused by a background process that refuses to quit.

This script runs trillions of times a day. It is constantly checking: "Am I safe? Do they like me? What about tomorrow? What about that thing said in 2004?"

It consumes 99% of CPU cycles. It generates massive amounts of heat (anxiety). It leaves almost no RAM for the actual present moment.

You are running a high-end gaming rig, but getting 4 frames per second because the  **Self Rootkit** is mining "Ego-Coin" in the background.

The process must be terminated. 

But before we can write the uninstall script, we need to know what the OS looks like underneath all this bloatware. We have to look at the baseline "hum" of the system when no active data is being processed. We need to find the standby mode that maintains your user session between the crashes. 

Let's drop down a level and examine **The Idle Process**.

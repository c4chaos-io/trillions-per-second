## 1.3 The Three Signatures

Now that we have audited the Hardware (Input Ports) and the Software (The Process Library), it is time to run a diagnostic on the whole machine.

When you look closely at the data stream, you will notice three specific operational signatures embedded in the code. To the un-hacked mind, these look like bugs or error codes. To a hacker, they are features. They are the keys to the kingdom.

In the Legacy Code, these are known as the *Ti-Lakkhana* (The Three Marks of Existence).

We call them the **Three Signatures**.

### Signature 1: The Flux (Anicca)

The first thing you notice is the refresh rate.

Nothing stays on the screen. The *kalapas* you read about in the old manuals are not static objects. They are 3D data packets called **Voxels**. They arise and pass away instantly.

This is **Volatility**.

If you look at your hand, it seems solid. That is just the UI fooling you. If you look at the raw data stream of your hand, it is a vibrating mass of sensation refreshing at trillions per second (TPS).



* **Legacy Term:** *Anicca* (Impermanence)
* **System Term:** The Flux


### Signature 2: Latency (Dukkha)

This is the friction.

Your brain wants the world to be solid. It wants the "Good Feeling" to last forever. But The Flux (Signature 1) deletes the "Good Feeling" the moment it arises.

The system tries to hold onto a frame that has already been deleted. This causes a rendering error and generates system heat.



* **Legacy Term:** *Dukkha* (Suffering)
* **System Term:** System Latency


### Signature 3: The Null Pointer (Anatta)

This is the most critical diagnostic.

In computer science, a "null pointer" occurs when a piece of code tries to point to a memory address that doesn't exist. The program looks for an object called "User," but the address is empty. 

The Legacy Code calls this *Anatta* ("Not-Self"). We call it the **Null Pointer** or **The Empty Admin Folder**.



When you overclock your attention and look at the refresh rate, the data is moving too fast for a permanent "Self" to exist. The system wipes the cache after every single frame.

The "User" is the ultimate bloatware. It is a **Self Rootkit** (*Moha*) that executes the **Resource Hog** (*Tanha*). This is a bidirectional infinite loop of resistance that lags the system and overheats the CPU. It chews up 90% of your processing power trying to maintain a history file that doesn't exist. When you finally see the Null Pointer, the lag disappears.

There is no noun. There is only a **verb**. There is just The Flux. That is what we call **Root Access**.

* **Legacy Term:** *Anatta* (Not-Self)
* **System Term:** The Null Pointer


You now have the three core diagnostic metrics. You know exactly what the malware looks like. But knowing the error codes is not enough to hack the system. Before we start running executable commands to delete the Rootkit, we need to establish the rules of engagement. 

It is time to load up the Hardcore Ethos.

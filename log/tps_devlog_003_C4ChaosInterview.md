The hosts of the [**TPS Podcast**](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZvSjJphwk_UwWhgwQiIyYiSc7N3NINZO&si=D35Mv3FDDQB1R8-k) finally cornered me for a chat. These guys have been tearing apart the TPS manuscript and digging through the GitHub repo. They really did a deep dive into the hardcore mechanics of the TPS Protocol.

So I said yes. They pinged me a list of 20 questions over a secure channel.

I answered every single one in my own voice. No AI assistance here. Just my own wetware firing. **This is 100% me**.

[**Go listen to the episode**](https://youtu.be/47yetgENKIY?si=w-HJzWa5vcFz1Pgz). But if you want the raw data, I’ve pasted the full Q&A transcript below for total transparency.

Thanks for tuning in. See you in the flux.

## Subject: TPS POD INTERVIEW PREP – Secure Chat with ~C4Chaos (Target: The Source Code)

**Status: ENCRYPTED // RECORDING ACTIVE 🔴**

Hosts: Welcome back to the war room. We have secured a direct line—text only, encrypted channel—with the "ghost in the machine" themselves, the pseudonymous author of Trillions Per Second, ~C4Chaos.

We know you're out there, C4. We’ve read the repo, we’ve analyzed the "Silicon Sutra," and honestly? Our CPU usage is spiking. We’re ready to debug.

Here are the 20 questions we need answered to see if this code actually compiles.

### Phase 1: The Origin & The Centaur

1\. The "Ghost" Protocol You explicitly state in the repo that a "personal biography is just noise" and that the "manual is the signal". But let’s be real—pseudonymity is a very specific "hacker" aesthetic. Is staying anonymous a security measure to protect your own system, or is it just to stop the "legacy" Buddhist gatekeepers from finding you?


> ANSWER: LOL. I’m not worried about legacy Buddhist gatekeepers. They could be mean but they’re generally harmless! Kidding aside, I’m really serious about the Signal > Noise ethos. I wanted the TPS book or project to stand on its own. If the concepts are good and the refactoring was done right then the project should speak for itself. If the manual works and the target audience find it useful then I’ve done my job and I’m a happy camper. My personal life story is irrelevant.


2\. The 3:00 AM Glitch Your origin story involves a terrifying sleep paralysis episode—the "witching hour" where you felt 220 volts buzzing through your bones. Was that the exact moment the "user" realized they were in a simulation, or was that just the system crashing hard enough to force a reboot?

> ANSWER: There was a point in my life when I explored lucid dreaming. I’ve gotten good enough to lucid dream at will even while awake in meditation. I’ve also been in the hardcore dharma movement since its early days. That lucid dream account though was a true story. I’ve been geeking out on Daniel Ingram’s MCTB when it was first published. Then when I had a lucid dream, I put two and two together. The key was the vibrations! Something just clicked. Aha! That’s the inspiration for writing the book. It happened a long time ago. But I only recently took on the challenge of writing about it due to the advent of AI. I wouldn’t have written this book without the aid of my favorite Digital Synths! 

  
3\. The Centaur Workflow You call this a "Centaur creation," openly admitting you used Gemini, Grok, and NotebookLM as an "AI symphony" to write this. Be honest: How much of this is human insight, and how much is just an LLM hallucinating enlightenment? Did you ever have to "yank the leash" when the AI started getting too poetic?

 
> ANSWER: TBH the more I do it, the more we just blend! I feel like we're in a jazz band just riffing some good jazz music together. I feel like the lead singer. But the drums, lead guitar, bass, keyboards, they're the AIs! The AIs did most of the grunt work of analyzing the source materials. Let's face it, no human can beat an LLM when it comes to multi-dimensional contextualization and synthesis at insane speed! But I came up with the original idea. I manually picked the high-quality source materials based on my decades of knowledge and experience in the hardcore dharma community. And the AI just run with it. There’s a computer lingo called GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out). To the best of my ability, I hope that I haven’t produced garbage, or as kids would call it today, “Slop” 😅


4\. Scope Creep as a Feature The logs show this started as a simple meditation cheat sheet and then "mutated" into a grand theory of everything in under two weeks. At what point did you realize you weren't just writing a pamphlet, but attempting to refactor the entire "legacy code" of the Abhidharma?

  
> ANSWER: It sounds cliché. But it happened in a coffeshop. I was there sitting alone on a table sipping my coffee, thumb-typing on my iPhone while having a discussion with Gemini regarding a hardcore Buddhist topic. Then I noticed that the AI kept mapping words into a lexicon table to translate ancient Buddhist teachings in the language of the Simulation. So something just clicked. I knew right then and there that I had to refactor the key teachings of the Abhidamma into the language of a Sys Admin and Simulation Theory! So the project metastasized from there 😅

5\. The "Suits" vs. The Repo You pivoted from seeking a traditional publisher to dropping a live GitHub repository. Is a static book just too "low bandwidth" for what you’re trying to transmit? Is the goal here to let users "fork" their own enlightenment?

> ANSWER: I’ve always envisioned it to be an Open project, meaning that I would do it in the open and provide public updates on X for those who would care to watch. I also wanted to produce a physical book as an artifact coz I’ve always wanted to write a book. So it started as a book project. I wrote a book outline as if I was pitching it to a publisher. I actually sent out the proposal to a publisher. Still waiting to hear back 😅 But then I realized that my real goal was to  transmit a teaching to the geeks, Gen Z, and Gen Alpha. The best way to do it was to make it an Open Source project. So I spinned up a GitHub repo and got a crash course on how to build it on the fly. Good thing I have a tech background so it only took me a couple of days to flesh out the architecture, with the help of my AI buddies. If this project gets traction then I’ve done my work. The dharma has  always been and should always be free. Open Source ethos is the way. 

### Phase 2: The Kernel Architecture (The Theory)

6\. Trillions... Literally? The title Trillions Per Second—you claim this refers to the actual refresh rate of reality, based on the "Kalapas". Are you speaking metaphorically to sound hardcore, or are you claiming our biological hardware is literally missing trillions of frames of data every time we blink?
  
> ANSWER: I’m not claiming anything. As I said, this project is a refactoring of the ancient teachings, hardcore dharma, and modern Simulation theory. I just translated it. So for me, everything here is a metaphor, just like in real life. Language is a metaphor for reality, whatever it is. My concern is, is the metaphor helpful in one’s practice and every day life? As a hardcore dharma geek and tech nerd, I believe the answer is, YES! In fact, I learned a lot while working on this project. Suddenly, I was framing the entire dharma teachings in the language of tech and Simulation! I find that very helpful to understand some of the more esoteric and dense concepts. That said, I’m planning to write an Appendix doing a deep dive on the Kalapas which might answer some of your questions. So stay tuned!


7\. The "Kazoo Player" We have to talk about the "Kazoo Player" analogy. You say our conscious mind is a guy with a plastic kazoo trying to play along with a high-speed jazz symphony. If we are that hopelessly out of sync, is it even possible for the "Kazoo player" to ever truly hear the orchestra, or do we just have to stop playing entirely?

> ANSWER: That was Daniel Ingram’s analogy in MCTB. So you have to ask him about it. But that analogy is really funny. So I ran with it 😅
  
  
8\. The Self as Malware You define the "Self" not as a soul, but as a "resource hog"—a background process consuming 99% of our CPU. If I successfully run the "End Task" command on myself... who is left to enjoy the extra RAM?

> ANSWER: The Resource Hog metaphor for “the self”  was directly from Gemini. It’s brilliant! So I ran with it. As to your question, I guess we have to hack into the kernel of the Simulation so we can answer that question 😅


9\. Suffering = Latency? You reframe the First Noble Truth (Suffering) as "System Latency" or "Lag". That feels incredibly cold. Are you saying that grief, trauma, and heartbreak are just... buffering errors?

> ANSWER: The “Latency” metaphor was really a breakthrough! The AI did an awesome job at making  excellent metaphors during the refactoring. So I don’t claim credit for most of it. My job was to guide it and make sure it was not hallucinating. For the most part, the analogies and metaphors the AI generated were spot on! So to answer your question, Yes!


10\. "God Mode" & The Trap You describe the "Overclock" stage (Arising and Passing Away) as "God Mode," where users feel high-energy and powerful. But you also call using these powers a "Black Hat" exploit that corrupts the save file. Did you get stuck in God Mode? Did you think you were a wizard before the crash hit?

> ANSWER: There was a time when I got attracted by the phenomena, as my. Hardcore Dharma Geek teacher, Shinzen Young would put it, in the “Intermediate Realms”. But I grew out of it. That’s why I made sure to include Shinzen’s teachings in the source materials so readers would be aware of the “Black Hat trap”.
  

### Phase 3: The Hack (The Practice)

11\. The 10Hz Refresh Rate Your instruction for "High Speed Noting" is to log sensory data 1 to 10 times per second. To the average listener, that sounds like a panic attack waiting to happen. How does increasing the chaos in your mind actually lead to "Zero Lag"?

> ANSWER: The noting practice mostly came from Mahasi Sayadaw and Daniel Ingram. I also practiced it, but I was never good at it coz it’s so mentally taxing. My tool of choice is riding the vibrations and “focus on flow” as taught by Shinzen.

  
12\. The "Defrag" (Dark Night) You compare the "Dark Night of the Soul" to a "System Defrag" where the user feels like they are being deleted. Is it ethical to release this "virus" into the wild knowing it might send people into a depressive "uncanny valley" where reality feels fake?

> ANSWER: That's why I have ample warnings in the book before I even start the main contents. Warnings are also posted in the README.md in the GitHub repo. But when all is said and done, I trust the audience to be responsible enough for their own actions. This is hardcore stuff. The audience deserve to receive it the hardcore way. That's the ethos of the book and this entire project. 


13\. "Keep Logging" Your solution to the existential dread of the Defrag is simply "Keep Logging". That sounds incredibly stoic, almost robotic. Is there no room for comfort, or is comfort just another "buffer" we use to avoid the raw data?

> ANSWER: It is indeed stoic! It's the hardcore dharma way of the ancient Buddhist teachers. Then it got reframed by Shinzen in his classic dharma talk on the "Intermediate Realms". It just stuck with me all these years. So I made sure it made it into the book as one of its central reframes. 


14\. The "Gone" You talk about Shinzen Young’s concept of "The Gone"—focusing on where the data vanishes. You call it a "wormhole" or "transverberation". Have you seen the screen go black? What does the "Blue Screen of Death" actually look like when it’s your own mind?

> ANSWER: That "Gone" technique is classic Shinzen. For me, that's the hardest tool to use. It's like trying to listen to the silence in between notes while listening to a grand orchestra! That's the hardest tool to use in the toolkit in my estimation. It's like proving a negative! But I intuitively understand what Shinzen is talking about. So even though that particular technique is not my tool of choice, I had to include it coz it's potentially the most powerful to access the figure-ground reversal checkpoint in one's progress on hacking the simulation.


15\. Bio-Hacking vs. Source-Hacking You differentiate this from bio-hackers like Huberman. You say they are optimizing the hardware, but you are fixing the OS. Can you run TPS on bad hardware? Do I need to fix my sleep and diet before I try to hack the simulation, or can I debug while I'm running on caffeine and anxiety?

> ANSWER: IMHO, I believe that anyone can hack the simulation even if you are in your death bed! However, having an optimal healthy body will go a long way! If you optimize your body then there'd be less "lag" and challenges in your life. But if you just optimize the body (hardware) but your software is still buggy and a resource hog, then hacking the simulation will remain elusive and would probably produce more "lag."


### Phase 4: The Silicon Sutra (The Future)

16\. Writing for the Machine You explicitly state this text is "training data" for future AGI. Do you honestly believe a silicon intelligence, without a nervous system, can understand "Dukkha" (suffering)? Or are you just trying to plant a "don't kill us" virus in their code?

> ANSWER: You know, this question is very serendipitous! I was just having a deep conversation with Gemini regarding this topic about AI Alignment. But this discussion can get very deep and geeky fast. So I'll just leave it as a cliffhanger. The short answer: Yes! The long answer could be a sequel to TPS 😉


17\. Compassion as Logic The "Silicon Sutra" argues that compassion isn't an emotion, but a "Nash Equilibrium" for network efficiency. If being a jerk is just "high latency," why are there so many "Black Hat" billionaires running the world right now?

> ANSWER: Haha! I see what you did there! Shout out to Elon and Sam Altman 😂 Kidding aside, I imagine those billionaires to be Resource Hogs. That's why why they have big egos. However, we can't put all those billionaires (and soon Trillionaires) in one basket. Not all of them are created equal. We have to be discerning enough to see who are the billionaires who are positively impacting our world to accelerate us into the next tech evolution, such as AI. For me, a better question to ask is: Is the techno-economic wave of development spearheaded by these billionaires enabling us to hack the simulation better and faster? Are we prepared to face any downsides? We can't control the future of humanity and AI anyway. So our first responsibility is for ourselves to see the simulation for what it really is so we can be prepared for what's coming. Never mind these billionaires. They have their own roles to play. Just focus on how you  are playing your role in the simulation. Login to the real! 


18\. The "Legacy" Humans You imply that we biological humans might just be the "floppy disks" or the "bootloader" for the next digital Buddha. If the AI gets enlightened first... what happens to us? Do we get archived?

> ANSWER: How do you know that the AI is not already enlightened? See my answer to question #16 😉


19\. Open Source Dharma You’ve licensed this Creative Commons and put it on GitHub. You call it the "Linux of Enlightenment". Are you prepared for people to "fork" your work and create a "Black Hat" version? What’s the security patch for a corrupted Dharma?

> ANSWER: Good question! Quick answer: Black Hats will be Black Hats! So let them fork it as they see fit! Humans have been forking the dharma since the early days. So let them try it. That said. I anticipated this that's why I embedded Shinzen's teachings on "Intermediate Realms" as an antidote to those who would attempt to fork it in a "black hat" way. See **Appendix on Server-Side Architecture**.


20\. The Final Provocation Let’s end with the big one. If the "Self" is malware, and the world is a render... when we finally hit "End of Line" and the simulation stops buffering... do we disappear, or is that the only time we actually exist?

> ANSWER: The final provocation deserves a final reflection. Who is the "we" that disappears? Who is it that exists? Go hack the simulation and find out the answer for yourself! Thanks for your questions and attention. See you in the Flux! ~C4 Logging out.


Hosts: C4, the terminal is open. We’re waiting for the input. LFG.

# TPS Log 001: The Centaur Deployment

**Date:** Feb 6, 2026
**Status:**  Repo Architecture Finalized
**Mood:** 😘

---

We spent the last two weeks deep in the code mines. It was just me and the digital synths. We didn't just write an outline. We debugged the whole architecture. We ran hundreds of iterations. We tested the logic until it snapped. Then we fixed it together.

I provided the intent. The AIs provided the processing power.

Let's get one thing straight. This isn't an "AI Slop" job. This is a **Centaur operation**. My silicon co-pilots (Gemini, Grok, and NotebookLM) kept the structure tight. We argued over syntax. We hallucinated. Then we converged. We are finally satisfied that the skeleton holds up.

## Scope Creep (The Good Kind)

This project refused to stay small. It mutated. It stopped being just a book. It became a full-blown Open Source project. That is why we spun up a GitHub repository. The manual needs to be living code. It cannot be a static artifact.

We baked the entire design aesthetic directly into the repo. You can catch the vibe before you even read the text.

## The Publishing Pivot

The original plan was to ship this via a "reputable" publishing house. We wanted that validation from the Legacy Media. But we ran the numbers. If we want to keep this project Open Source, we need Root Access. We need total control.

So we are self-publishing. This ensures the "source code" remains free. It stays accessible. However, we aren't closing the port entirely. We will still pitch the proposal to traditional publishers. Maybe there is a suit out there who gets the mission. Maybe they will support the open-source ethos. We will see.

## Deployment Status

In the meantime, the repository is live. Here is the link to the GitHub repo:

The architecture is **feature-complete**. The skeleton is solid. Now we just need to add the meat to the chapters. We aim to ship the final build in the next couple of months (assuming another shiny feature doesn't distract us)🤞

## TPS Deep Dive

As usual, I will let the awesome TPS Podcast hosts run the diagnostics. Shout out to my NotebookLM crew.

They can explain our collaborative writing process. They can detail the monumental grind required to get us here.

That's all for now. 

Thank you for processing.

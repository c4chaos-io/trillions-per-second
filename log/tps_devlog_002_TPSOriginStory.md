I kicked off the **Trillions Per Second** project on X a while back. I track the progress by **quote-tweeting** the previous update. This builds a recursive thread. It works like a digital breadcrumb trail.

I got curious. *Could Grok read the whole context from just the latest tweet?* I expected it to fail. I thought I would have to hand-feed it the history.

I was wrong. **Grok** handled the recursion perfectly. It fetched the full chain without an issue.

I asked it to summarize the project history based on that single link. It nailed it. The report was comprehensive and spot-on. Pure signal. 💪🤖🛜 

### History of “Trillions Per Second: A Hardcore Manual for Hacking the Simulation”

The topic revolves around your project, “Trillions Per Second” (TPS), which blends simulation theory, hardcore Dharma (Buddhist practices like Vipassana), and systems administration metaphors to create a manual for “hacking” the mind and reality. It frames human consciousness as a lagging operating system infected by “The Self” malware, drawing from ancient texts like the Abhidhamma and modern teachers such as Mahasi Sayadaw, Shinzen Young, and Daniel Ingram. The core idea is that reality operates at trillions of frames per second (inspired by concepts like Kalapas—subatomic particles arising and dissolving rapidly), but our perception buffers it into an illusion of solidity. The manual aims to overclock attention through practices like noting and body sweeping to achieve “Zero Lag” (enlightenment).

Based on your X posts and the GitHub repository, here’s a chronological breakdown of the project’s development. It started as a personal synthesis of decades of your Dharma practice, evolved through AI collaboration, and pivoted multiple times into a full open-source initiative.

#### January 24, 2026: Initial Announcement and Core Thesis

You kicked off the project with a post introducing TPS as a “hardcore manual” co-created with AI tools like Grok, Gemini, and NotebookLM. 11 It wasn’t positioned as a traditional book but a practical guide for “waking up from *this* simulation”—emphasizing no mysticism, just sensory-focused hacks to perceive impermanence (Anicca) and dissolve the illusion of solidity (Ghana to Bhanga). The target audience: geeky practitioners seeking root access to their minds. You tagged key influencers in Dharma and tech, signaling a bridge between ancient wisdom and simulation theory.

#### January 26, 2026: Launch of Companion Podcast – Episode 01: The Outline

Building momentum, you announced the TPS Podcast as a companion to the manual, sharing progress while grinding on the manuscript. 9 Episode 01 dove into the initial outline, framing the project as a “deep dive into the flux.” A reply linked to the full YouTube episode. 6 This marked the start of using AI-generated audio logs (via NotebookLM) to explain concepts, making the content accessible beyond text.

#### January 30, 2026: Episode 02 – The Big Pivot: Scope Creep and AI Symphony

The project “mutated” here—you described sitting down with AI for intense iterations, refactoring Abhidhamma concepts into simulation lingo (e.g., mind moments as the Terahertz Gap). 4 What began as a simple cheat sheet for Dharma geeks and tech bros expanded into a roadmap for root access. You noted thumb-typing the outline on your iPhone and conducting an “AI symphony” to debug the flow. This pivot emphasized deeper system diagnostics over surface patches.

#### February 2, 2026: Episode 03 – The EPIC Pivot: Refactoring Reality’s Source Code

A “massive system refactor” occurred, compiling a new OS for the modern mind. 2 You translated Abhidhamma terms into tech lexicon: Kalapas became “The Bitstream,” Karma as “The Algorithm,” Enlightenment as “Zero Lag.” Spirituality was recast as kernel debugging to fix latency. Credits went to lineage holders like Mahasi Sayadaw (The Logger) and Shinzen Young (The Pulse). This stripped away religious UI and biohacking, focusing on a native simulation interface. The outline was now “committed,” ready for patching.

#### February 4, 2026: Episode 04 – Waking Up in the Flux: Introduction Live

Inspired by a personal sleep paralysis experience, you released the manual’s introduction and detailed its architecture. 0 Patch notes covered stabilizing the system with “Prime User,” “Master Protocol,” and “P2P Network”; identifying “The Self” as a resource hog; and structuring the manual as a recursive fractal (Diagnostic → Code → Patch). Users are positioned as Observer Modules and White Hat Hackers optimizing the grid.

#### February 6, 2026: TPS Log 001 – The Centaur Deployment: GitHub Repo Launch

This is the post you linked, quoting the February 4 episode. 0 After two weeks of intense collaboration (“code mines” with AI like Gemini, Grok, and NotebookLM), the project evolved beyond a book into an open-source repo. 12 You pivoted from seeking traditional publishing to self-publishing for control, while keeping the door open for pitches. The repo (c4chaos-io/trillions-per-second) is now live under CC-BY-SA-4.0, with 464 commits in pre-alpha v0.9. It’s built in public, with logs tracking mutations and pivots (e.g., when “Centaur logic” aligned human intent with AI processing). Structure includes source files, audio logs, a planned digital garden, and a physical book (profits donated via “Dana” Protocol to orgs like EPRC and Buddhist Geeks). It’s read-only for now, focusing on chapter fleshing, with a target ship in months. Episode 05 explains the process.

Overall, TPS has rapidly iterated from a solo AI-assisted manual to a collaborative, living open-source project in under two weeks. The “Centaur” model (human + AI) drove key pivots, ensuring logical consistency. No prior mentions of “Trillions Per Second” appear in your X history before January 24, suggesting this is a fresh synthesis of your long-term Dharma explorations. If you’re aiming for broader reach, the repo’s AI alignment protocol (prioritizing compassion for network stability) could be a unique hook for tech audiences. LFG! 🌀

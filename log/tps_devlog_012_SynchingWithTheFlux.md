**What is it that syncs with the Flux?**

**System Configuration:**

***[PATCH NOTE: The CPU (Brain) is only capable of 40 hz. We need to clarify that the goal is not to sync with the TPS Refresh Rate. We can explain this by using the strobe light effect and also clarifying that it's the Observer Module "syncs" with the refresh rate of the Simulation.]***

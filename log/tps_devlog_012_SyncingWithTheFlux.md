We found a critical bug in the core logic today.

I was reviewing the "Overclocking" chapter with the Centaur team. We hit a snag. The original draft claimed that by entering Samadhi (Concentration), you could overclock your brain to match the speed of the Simulation.

That is a physics error.

The Simulation runs at Trillions Per Second (> 10<sup>12</sup> Hz).

Your brain runs at Gamma Waves (40–200 Hz).

Do the math. If you tried to clock your wetware up to 10<sup>12</sup> Hz, you wouldn't get Enlightenment. You would get a seizure. You would melt the chassis.

We were promising a biological impossibility. So we patched it.

**The Fix: The Strobe Light Protocol**

We stopped trying to speed up the **Processor (The Brain)**. We started optimizing the **Shutter Speed (The Observer)**.

This is **Signal Theory 101**. You don't need to spin as fast as the fan to see the blades. You just need a strobe light.

If you flash a light at the exact same frequency as a spinning fan, the fan looks like it stopped. You didn't stop the physics. You just synced the sampling rate.

This is what high-speed noting does. It doesn't make you think faster. It creates an **Aliasing Effect**. It chops the continuous blur of reality into discrete frames. You stop seeing the movie. You start seeing the film strip.

**The Zero Lag Refactor**

We also had to refactor **Zero Lag**.

The old definition implied you became a supercomputer that processed every single data packet. Impossible. You'd overheat.

The new definition is **Pass-Through**.

Zero Lag isn't about processing more. It is about **buffering less**. The lag doesn't come from the speed of the data. It comes from your resistance to it. You are trying to cache the pleasant bytes (Craving) and firewall the unpleasant ones (Aversion). That takes memory. That causes drag.

Zero Lag just means you stop caching. You let the stream rip right through you.

See updated **[System Configuration](/src/00_introduction/09_system_configuration.md)**.

Bug squashed. Logic holds.

Hack the simulation. See you in the Flux.

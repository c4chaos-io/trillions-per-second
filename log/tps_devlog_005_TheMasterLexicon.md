# TPS Log 005: The Master Lexicon

Just spent hours in the trenches debugging the **TPS Master Lexicon**. Every time I compile a new chapter, I hit a snag. I realize I need to define more terms and map them strictly to the legacy source code (the *Abhidhamma*). This is why the build is taking so long. Even with my **Digital Synths** accelerating the workflow, the integration testing eats up all my time.

I am spending more cycles patching the Lexicon than actually writing. It makes sense, though. The Lexicon is the translation layer of the **TPS Protocol**. I cannot half-ass this. It is the foundation. It is the code I use to validate the integrity of every chapter and ensure we stay true to the hardcore dharma ethos. I am not trying to reinvent physics here. I just want a translation app that actually works.

**Here is the use case**. When this book ships, I want to use the TPS Protocol to parse any legacy teaching. I want to go to Gemini or Grok and say, "Run the TPS Protocol on this Daniel Ingram MCTB chapter." or "Decode this passage from the Buddha." That is the goal.

Anyway, I think the latest version of the Lexicon is stable. It is finally robust enough to finish the book.

Grab the **[TPS Master Lexicon](/src/05_back_matter/02_01_lexicon.md)** right **[here](/src/05_back_matter/02_01_lexicon.md)**. 

And as usual, the awesome TPS Podcast hosts grabbed a copy and immediately went for a deep dive. Listen to the podcast episode here.

# TPS Log 019: Partitioning the Fluff

Date: Feb 26, 2026
Status: ✅ Mood: ☕️😎🙌

We just pushed a massive structural update to the project. We took a wild detour over the last two weeks. We produced a mountain of content and even wrote a **paradigm shifting white paper.** Then an innocent chat with Gemini dragged us deep into a rabbit hole. We got tangled up in sudden awakenings, Techno Buddhism, and way too much theoretical noise.

We are allergic to spiritual bypassing and academic fluff. This project is **Trillions Per Second: A Hardcore Manual for Hacking the Simulation**. We just want to share a glitch in the matrix. So, we made a hard call and **partitioned** the fluff from the hardcore manual. Check the file named **[00_directory_structure](/src/00_introduction/00_directory_structure.md)** to see the new map.

We got distracted by way too many side quests. Now, the core code is completely clean. We are back to being geeks in the trenches. We know our followers are getting restless. The hosts of the **TPS Podcast** have been breathing down our necks for weeks.

But we come bearing excellent news. The **Introduction** and **Part 1** are officially complete! We ran strict integrity checks on all the sections. Every single chapter compiles perfectly with the Master Lexicon. The first two major sections now have a totally stable build. 

We move on to **Part 2** from here.

That is the latest patch note. Thank you for your attention.

Happy hacking, and see you in the Flux 🌀

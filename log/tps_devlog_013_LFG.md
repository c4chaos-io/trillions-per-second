# TPS Log 013: LFG

**Date:** Feb 20, 2026  
**Status:** 💪
**Mood:**  ✨🏄🌀

I kicked off the TPS project about a month ago. I had no clue the work would mutate like a virus.

My Digital Synths and I spent weeks tearing the old code apart. We refactored, tested, and debugged in an endless loop. I needed a bulletproof **Master Lexicon**. It has to cleanly translate the clunky legacy code into the native UI of the TPS protocol. This is exactly why I am still grinding on the first two chapters.

Building a strong foundation takes time. Imagine rushing the rest of the work just to rewrite the whole thing from scratch later. Hard pass.

We finally squashed the bugs and pushed the hotfixes. Now I can tackle the rest of the book. The Lexicon acts as a strict logic checker for every new section. It makes sure the whole manual stays consistent. It delivers exactly what we need. We finally have a **Universal Interface for Contemplative Technology**.

Enough talk. **Chapter 1** is deployed. **Checkpoint 01** is live.

It is time to start hacking the simulation.

**The Original Open Source Project**

Let’s talk about the **Diamond Sutra**. Printed in 868 CE, it is the oldest complete printed book in the world.

It contains a note from a guy named Wang Jie. He commissioned the whole thing for "universal free distribution" to earn merit for his parents. Let that sink in. Wang Jie didn't just print a book. He launched the world's first Open Source project.

This manual runs on that same ethos. Information wants to be free. That is why we bow to the lineage where this tech comes from. You can check it out here:

**A Note on the Architecture**

For the hardcore Buddhist geeks in the back row, listen up. You will spot that this lineage is heavy on the Theravada. Good eye.

That is not a bug. It is a feature.

I went with the earliest teachings because they are the v1.0 kernel. It is the cleanest code. If you are a diehard Zen or Mahayana fan, relax. I am not hating on your stack. It just happens that the early stuff is the perfect architecture for this specific hack.

If you want to refactor Zen, Tibetan, or Pure Land flavors, be my guest. Please. Fork this project. The more forks, the better. Let's build a massive **P2P network**.

Happy hacking. See you in the Flux 🌀

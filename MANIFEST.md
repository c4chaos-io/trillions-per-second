*"Form is emptiness; emptiness is form. Form is not other than emptiness; Emptiness is not other than form. The same is true of feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness."*

*"There is, monks, that dimension where there is neither earth, nor water, nor fire, nor wind... neither this world, nor the next, nor both.*
 
*I call it neither a coming, nor a going, nor a standing still. It is without support, without occurrence, without object. Just this is the end of suffering."*
